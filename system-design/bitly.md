Let’s take one of the most commonly asked **system design questions**: **"Design a URL Shortening Service (like Bit.ly)"** and break it down step-by-step:

---

### 1. **Clarify Requirements**
#### Functional Requirements:
- A user can input a long URL and get a shortened URL.
- When a user accesses the shortened URL, it should redirect them to the original URL.
- Expiry dates for shortened URLs (optional).
- Analytics: Track how many times the shortened URL was accessed (optional).

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
- The system should be highly available and low latency.
- The system should handle a high number of read and write requests.
- URLs should be unique and not collide.

---

### 2. **High-Level Design**
- Users interact with the **frontend** to submit a long URL.
- The **backend** generates a unique short identifier (key) and maps it to the original URL.
- A **database** stores mappings of short URLs to long URLs.
- When a user accesses the short URL, the system retrieves the original URL from the database and redirects.

---

### 3. **Component Breakdown**
#### a. **Frontend**
- A simple UI where users can enter long URLs and get a shortened URL.
- API to handle requests (e.g., `/shorten` and `/expand`).

#### b. **Backend**
- **URL Shortening Service**:
  - Accepts the long URL.
  - Generates a unique key for the URL (e.g., "abc123").
  - Returns the full shortened URL (e.g., `http://short.ly/abc123`).

- **Redirection Service**:
  - Accepts the shortened URL.
  - Looks up the original URL in the database.
  - Redirects the user to the original URL.

#### c. **Database**
- Stores mappings of shortened URLs to long URLs.
- Example schema:
  ```
  ShortURL    | LongURL               | CreatedAt   | Expiry
  abc123      | https://google.com    | 2024-12-01  | NULL
  def456      | https://openai.com    | 2024-12-10  | 2024-12-31
  ```

#### d. **Key Generation**
- Use **Base62 encoding** to generate a short key (digits `0-9`, lowercase `a-z`, uppercase `A-Z`).
- To ensure uniqueness:
  - Use a **hashing algorithm** (e.g., MD5/SHA) and truncate.
  - Alternatively, use an **incremental counter** stored in the database.

#### e. **Caching**
- Frequently accessed URLs can be stored in a **cache** (e.g., Redis) to reduce database lookups.

---

### 4. **Scalability**
#### a. **Database Partitioning**
- Use sharding to distribute URL mappings across multiple databases based on the short URL key (e.g., hash of the key modulo the number of shards).

#### b. **CDN**
- Use a **Content Delivery Network** (CDN) to serve frequently accessed short URLs with minimal latency.

#### c. **Load Balancing**
- Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across backend servers.

#### d. **Analytics Service**
- Store access logs in a separate system like Kafka and process them for analytics (e.g., popular URLs).

---

### 5. **Failure Handling**
- **Database Replication**: Use master-slave replication to ensure high availability.
- **Retry Logic**: Implement retries for database and cache failures.
- **Graceful Fallback**: If the cache fails, fallback to querying the database.

---

### 6. **Extending the System**
- **Custom URLs**: Allow users to specify custom short keys (e.g., `http://short.ly/my-url`).
- **URL Expiry**: Allow users to set expiration dates for URLs.
- **User Authentication**: Provide user accounts to track and manage shortened URLs.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting the number of URL generations per user/IP.
- **Security**: Use HTTPS to encrypt traffic and sanitize user inputs to prevent malicious redirects.

### 7. **Diagram**
Here’s a simple architecture diagram:

```
+------------+        +-------------+       +-------------+
|   Client   | -----> |   Frontend  | ----> | URL Service  |
+------------+        +-------------+       +-------------+
                               |                    |
                               |                    |
                               V                    V
                         +----------+         +------------+
                         |  Cache   |         |  Database   |
                         +----------+         +------------+
                               ^
                               |
                      +----------------+
                      | Redirection API |
                      +----------------+
```

### 8. **Trade-offs**
#### Advantages:
- Simple design with minimal components.
- Highly scalable using caching, CDNs, and sharding.

#### Limitations:
- If the key generation algorithm isn't well-designed, it may cause collisions or poor distribution across shards.
- Hot URLs may overload a single cache or database node.

### Example Answer:
When asked, explain the design step-by-step, starting from requirements, breaking the system into components, and ending with scaling and trade-offs. Use a diagram to visualize the architecture and conclude with how you'd improve the system.
