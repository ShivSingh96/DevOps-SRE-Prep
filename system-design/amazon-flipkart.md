### System Design Example: **Design an E-Commerce System (like Amazon/Flipkart)**

---

### 1. **Clarify Requirements**
#### Functional Requirements:
1. Users can browse/search for products.
2. Users can add products to their cart and place orders.
3. The system should handle payments.
4. Users can track orders (order status: shipped, delivered, etc.).
5. Admins can add, update, or remove products.

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. High availability and scalability.
2. Low latency for searching and browsing products.
3. Data consistency for orders and payments.
4. Ability to handle large-scale traffic (e.g., Black Friday sales).

---

### 2. **High-Level Design**
#### Core Components:
1. **Product Catalog**: Manages product listings and metadata.
2. **Search Service**: Allows users to search products by keyword or filters.
3. **Cart Service**: Stores user carts.
4. **Order Management**: Processes user orders.
5. **Payment Service**: Handles payment transactions securely.
6. **Delivery Service**: Tracks order shipments and deliveries.
7. **Admin Service**: Enables product and inventory management.

---

### 3. **Component Breakdown**

#### a. **Frontend**
- Provides the user interface for browsing, searching, and purchasing products.
- Handles different types of users: customers and admins.

#### b. **Backend**
- **Product Catalog Service**:
  - Stores product details like name, price, description, and stock.
  - Supports caching for faster product retrieval.

- **Search Service**:
  - Uses a search engine (e.g., Elasticsearch) for keyword-based and filtered product searches.
  - Indexes product metadata to improve search efficiency.

- **Cart Service**:
  - Stores user carts in a distributed in-memory store (e.g., Redis).
  - Supports operations like adding/removing items and calculating totals.

- **Order Management**:
  - Coordinates with the payment service and inventory system to process orders.
  - Maintains order states (e.g., pending, confirmed, shipped).

- **Payment Service**:
  - Integrates with external payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
  - Ensures secure payment processing using encryption and tokenization.

- **Delivery Service**:
  - Tracks shipping status via integration with third-party logistics providers.
  - Updates the user with real-time tracking.

- **Admin Service**:
  - Manages product listings, inventory, and promotional campaigns.

### 4. **Database Design**
#### Databases:
- **Product Catalog Database** (SQL or NoSQL):
  ```
  Products Table:
  ID  | Name       | Price  | Stock | Category | Description | CreatedAt
  ----+------------+--------+-------+----------+-------------+-----------
   1  | iPhone 15  | 1000   | 20    | Phones   | ...         | ...
  ```

- **Orders Database** (Relational DB for consistency):
  ```
  Orders Table:
  ID  | UserID | OrderStatus | TotalPrice | CreatedAt | UpdatedAt
  ----+--------+-------------+------------+-----------+----------
   1  | 101    | Shipped     | 1500       | ...       | ...
  ```

- **User Cart Database** (In-Memory Store like Redis):
  ```
  Key: UserID
  Value: Cart Details
  ```

- **Analytics Database** (Big Data Store for insights):
  Tracks user behavior and sales trends.

---

### 5. **Scalability and Optimization**
#### a. **Caching**
- Use Redis or Memcached to cache product metadata and search results.

#### b. **CDN**
- Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static content like images and stylesheets.

#### c. **Database Sharding**
- Shard databases by user ID or product ID to distribute the load.

#### d. **Microservices**
- Design each service (e.g., cart, orders, payments) as a separate microservice for scalability and fault isolation.

#### e. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- Use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle asynchronous tasks like order confirmation emails or updating inventory after a sale.

#### f. **Load Balancing**
- Deploy a load balancer (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB) to distribute traffic across multiple servers.

---

### 6. **Failure Handling**
- **Retry Mechanism**: Retry failed payment transactions.
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Handle unprocessed events in the message queue.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Show cached product information if the database is down.

---

### 7. **Extending the System**
- **Recommendation Engine**:
  - Suggest products to users based on browsing and purchase history.
  - Use machine learning models or collaborative filtering.

- **Inventory Management**:
  - Automatically restock products based on demand forecasts.

- **Customer Reviews**:
  - Allow users to add reviews and ratings for products.

- **Promotions**:
  - Offer discounts and coupons managed by the admin.

### 9. **Trade-offs**
#### Advantages:
- Decoupled microservices allow independent scaling.
- High availability and fault isolation.
- Asynchronous processing improves system responsiveness.

#### Limitations:
- Increased complexity in managing multiple microservices.
- Eventual consistency might delay updates to the product inventory.

### Example Answer:
When answering, walk through the functional requirements, propose a modular design, and dive into each component. Use diagrams to make your architecture clearer. Always discuss scalability, failure handling, and future extensions to show depth in your solution.
