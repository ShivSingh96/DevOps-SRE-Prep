### System Design for **BookMyShow**

#### Problem Statement:
Design an online ticket booking system like BookMyShow, which allows users to book movie/event tickets, select seats, and make payments. The system must handle high traffic and ensure consistent seat availability.

---

#### Key Requirements:
1. **User Features:**
   - Browse events/movies, select seats, and make payments.
2. **Real-Time Seat Availability:**
   - Lock and release seats during booking to avoid conflicts.
3. **High Availability:**
   - Handle peak traffic during event launches.
4. **Scalable Payment System:**
   - Integrate with payment gateways and handle retries.

---

### **1. Components**

#### Core Components:
1. **Frontend:**
   - React or Angular for user interface.
2. **Backend:**
   - Microservices for event management, booking, payments, and notifications.
3. **Database:**
   - **Relational Database:** Store user data, bookings, and event details.
   - **Distributed Cache (Redis):** Real-time seat locking mechanism.
4. **Load Balancer:**
   - Distribute traffic across services.
5. **Message Queue:**
   - **Kafka/SQS:** Handle notifications and asynchronous tasks.
6. **Search Engine:**
   - **Elasticsearch:** Search for movies/events.

#### AWS Services:
1. **Compute:**
   - ECS for microservices, Lambda for background tasks.
2. **Storage:**
   - DynamoDB or RDS for event and user data.
3. **Networking:**
   - CloudFront for frontend CDN and API Gateway for backend APIs.
4. **Monitoring:**
   - CloudWatch for metrics and alerts.

### **3. Handling High Traffic for Bookings**
1. **Seat Locking:**
   - Use Redis for real-time locking. Expire locks after 5 minutes.
2. **Load Balancing:**
   - Use AWS ALB or NLB to distribute requests.
3. **Scalable Database:**
   - Partition data by geography or event ID.
4. **Asynchronous Payments:**
   - Confirm bookings only after payment completion.
5. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Use AWS WAF to throttle abusive users.

           +--------------------------------------------+

```

### **Component Explanation**
1. **API Gateway:** Serves as a centralized gateway for user requests, routing them to relevant services.
2. **User Service:** Manages user profiles, authentication, and account-related operations.
3. **Booking Service:** Handles real-time ticket bookings, seat selection, and availability checks.
4. **Payment Service:** Processes payments securely using integrated payment gateways.
5. **Seat Locking Service:** Temporarily locks seats for users during booking to avoid conflicts.
6. **Notification Service:** Sends booking confirmation, reminders, or updates via email/SMS.
7. **Cache (Redis):** Maintains seat availability in real time for fast access.
8. **Admin Dashboard:** Allows admins to manage events, movies, pricing, and view analytics.

---

### **Handling High Volume (For Both Systems)**

1. **Load Balancing:** Use AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic across multiple backend instances.
2. **Scaling:** Deploy microservices on Kubernetes or ECS with auto-scaling enabled to handle traffic spikes.
3. **Caching:** Use Redis or Memcached for low-latency data access.
4. **Message Queue:** Use Kafka or AWS SQS for decoupling services (e.g., processing notifications or payment retries).
5. **Storage Scaling:** Use DynamoDB for horizontal scalability or sharded RDS for structured data.
