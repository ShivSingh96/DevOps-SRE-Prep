### System Design for **SurveyMonkey**

#### Problem Statement:
Design a scalable online survey platform like SurveyMonkey, where users can create surveys and collect responses from thousands or even millions of participants. The system must handle high traffic and provide a seamless user experience.

---

#### Key Requirements:
1. **Survey Creation:**
   - Users can create surveys with custom questions and answer types (e.g., multiple choice, free text, ratings).
2. **Survey Response Collection:**
   - Handle high concurrency when participants submit responses.
3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Provide aggregated data, insights, and export capabilities.
4. **High Availability and Scalability:**
   - Handle sudden traffic spikes during peak surveys.
5. **Security:**
   - Protect user data and survey responses.

### **1. Components**

#### Core Components:
1. **Frontend:** 
   - React or Angular for survey creation and response collection.
2. **Backend:**
   - RESTful or GraphQL APIs for survey management.
   - Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), or Java (Spring Boot).
3. **Database:** 
   - **Relational Database (RDS):** Stores metadata like surveys, questions, and user data.
   - **NoSQL Database (DynamoDB, MongoDB):** Stores responses for fast write and read operations.
4. **Message Queue:** 
   - **Kafka or AWS SQS:** Decouple components for background processing like analysis and exports.
5. **Data Processing:** 
   - For real-time analytics and insights, use Apache Flink or AWS Lambda with Kinesis.
6. **Cache:**
   - **Redis or Memcached:** Caching frequent survey questions, configurations, and results.
7. **Storage:**
   - **S3:** Store static assets (e.g., images, exports) and survey exports.
8. **Load Balancer:**
   - Distribute traffic across backend servers (AWS ALB/ELB).
9. **Search Engine:**
   - **Elasticsearch:** Full-text search for surveys and responses.

#### AWS Services:
1. **Compute:**
   - EC2, ECS (Fargate), or Lambda for backend APIs.
2. **Database:**
   - Amazon Aurora (Relational), DynamoDB (NoSQL), or RDS with MySQL/Postgres.
3. **Networking:**
   - API Gateway for REST/GraphQL endpoints.
   - Route 53 for DNS.
4. **Storage:**
   - S3 for assets and logs.
5. **Monitoring:**
   - CloudWatch for logs, metrics, and alerts.
   - AWS X-Ray for tracing API requests.
6. **CI/CD:**
   - CodePipeline, CodeDeploy for automated deployment.

### **2. High-Level Architecture**

**Components Explained:**
1. **Load Balancer:** Handles incoming traffic and routes to backend servers.
2. **Frontend:** Survey creation and response UIs are served via a CDN (e.g., CloudFront).
3. **Backend APIs:** Responsible for handling CRUD operations for surveys, responses, and analytics.
4. **Database:** Relational database for survey metadata and NoSQL for fast writes of responses.
5. **Message Queue:** Used for processing responses asynchronously for analysis.
6. **Analytics Engine:** Processes responses and generates real-time insights.

---

### **3. Handling a High Volume of Responses**
1. **Horizontal Scaling:** 
   - Use ECS or Kubernetes to add more backend instances during peak loads.
2. **Queue Backpressure:**
   - Use Kafka/SQS to offload response processing, ensuring the API remains responsive.
3. **Sharding Databases:**
   - Partition responses across multiple databases based on survey IDs.
4. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Use AWS API Gateway or WAF to throttle requests during surges.
5. **Caching:**
   - Use Redis for frequently accessed survey metadata to reduce DB load.

### **Component Explanation**
1. **API Gateway:** Acts as the single entry point for users, exposing APIs for creating surveys, submitting responses, and fetching results.
2. **Survey Service:** Handles survey creation and management (CRUD operations).
3. **Response Service:** Handles the storage and retrieval of responses, with an efficient write path using a NoSQL database (e.g., DynamoDB).
4. **Analytics Service:** Processes data to generate insights, charts, and downloadable reports for users.
5. **Notification Service:** Sends email/SMS reminders for survey participation or completion.
6. **Database Service:**
   - Relational Database (e.g., RDS): Stores user data and survey metadata.
   - NoSQL Database (e.g., DynamoDB): Stores large volumes of survey responses.
7. **Cache (Redis):** Caches survey questions and metadata for high-speed access during survey response collection.
