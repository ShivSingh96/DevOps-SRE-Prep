## If I have 2 http rules, one allowed at subnet level with rule no 75 and another rule denied at subnet level with rule no 80, Which one will take precedence & what will be effect?
In the context of firewall rules within a cloud environment (such as Google Cloud Platform or AWS), the rule with the lowest priority number takes precedence over rules with higher priority numbers. Here's how the precedence and effect will work in your case:

### Precedence of Firewall Rules

- **Rule Priority**: The priority of a rule is determined by its rule number. Lower numbers have higher priority.
- **Rule Matching**: When a packet matches multiple rules, the rule with the highest priority (i.e., the lowest number) will be applied.

### Given Rules

- **Rule No. 75**: Allows HTTP traffic at the subnet level.
- **Rule No. 80**: Denies HTTP traffic at the subnet level.

### Which Rule Takes Precedence?

- **Rule No. 75 (Allow)**: Has a lower rule number (75) compared to Rule No. 80.
- **Rule No. 80 (Deny)**: Has a higher rule number (80).

Since Rule No. 75 has a lower number, it has higher priority and will take precedence over Rule No. 80.

### Effect

- **HTTP Traffic**: Allowed at the subnet level because Rule No. 75 (Allow) has higher priority than Rule No. 80 (Deny).
- **Precedence Handling**: The allow rule (75) is evaluated first, and since it allows the traffic, the deny rule (80) is not applied.

### Summary

In this scenario, Rule No. 75 will take precedence, and as a result, HTTP traffic will be allowed at the subnet level. The deny rule (Rule No. 80) will not take effect because it has a lower priority compared to the allow rule.

## If I apply same rule at subnet level & security group level, which will take precedence?
The precedence of rules applied at different levels (subnet vs. security group) depends on the specific cloud provider's implementation of firewall and security rules. Here's a general explanation based on common cloud provider practices, such as AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

### General Precedence Concept

1. **Subnet-Level Rules (Network ACLs)**:
   - Subnet-level rules, often called Network Access Control Lists (ACLs), operate at the subnet level and affect all resources within the subnet.
   - These rules are typically stateless, meaning that both inbound and outbound rules need to be defined explicitly.

2. **Security Group Rules**:
   - Security groups are associated with individual instances (e.g., virtual machines) and act as virtual firewalls for those instances.
   - These rules are typically stateful, meaning that if you allow an inbound request, the response is automatically allowed.

### Precedence of Rules

- **AWS**:
  - In AWS, both Network ACLs and Security Groups are applied simultaneously.
  - **Security Groups**: If security groups allow traffic but Network ACLs deny it, the traffic will be denied.
  - **Network ACLs**: If Network ACLs allow traffic but security groups deny it, the traffic will be denied.
  - In essence, the more restrictive rule between the subnet-level ACLs and security group rules will take precedence.

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:
  - GCP primarily uses firewall rules associated with networks (subnets) and instances (via tags).
  - **Priority Order**: GCP firewall rules have priorities assigned, and the rule with the lowest priority number takes precedence.
  - **Combined Effect**: Both subnet-level and instance-level (security group equivalent) rules are evaluated. The most restrictive effective rule will be applied.

### Specific Scenario

If you apply the same rule at both the subnet level and the security group level, the effective behavior will be determined by the combined evaluation of these rules. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Subnet-Level Rule**:
   - Applies to all resources within the subnet.
   - If the subnet-level rule is more restrictive (e.g., deny traffic), it will effectively block the traffic regardless of the security group rules.

2. **Security Group Rule**:
   - Applies to specific instances within the subnet.
   - If the security group rule is more restrictive (e.g., deny traffic), it will block traffic to the specific instance, even if the subnet-level rule allows it.

### Example Scenarios

1. **AWS Example**:
   - **Subnet Rule**: Allow HTTP traffic.
   - **Security Group Rule**: Deny HTTP traffic.
   - **Result**: HTTP traffic will be denied because the security group rule is more restrictive.

2. **GCP Example**:
   - **Subnet Rule Priority 100**: Allow HTTP traffic.
   - **Security Group Rule Priority 200**: Deny HTTP traffic.
   - **Result**: HTTP traffic will be allowed because the rule with the lower priority number (100) takes precedence.

3. **GCP Example with Reverse Priorities**:
   - **Subnet Rule Priority 200**: Allow HTTP traffic.
   - **Security Group Rule Priority 100**: Deny HTTP traffic.
   - **Result**: HTTP traffic will be denied because the rule with the lower priority number (100) takes precedence.

### Summary

- **AWS**: The more restrictive rule between the subnet-level (Network ACL) and the security group will take precedence.
- **GCP**: The rule with the lowest priority number (highest priority) will take precedence. If the same rule is applied at both levels, the combined effect will depend on the specific priority settings.

Understanding these interactions is crucial for effectively managing network security in cloud environments. Always refer to the specific documentation of your cloud provider for the most accurate and detailed information.
