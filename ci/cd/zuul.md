In Zuul, a popular open-source continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) system used primarily with the OpenStack project, the concepts of "check pipelines" and "gate pipelines" are integral to its workflow management.

### Check Pipelines
- **Definition:** Check pipelines in Zuul are responsible for running jobs that perform automated tests, linting, and other non-blocking tasks.
- **Purpose:** These pipelines are designed to quickly validate changes submitted by developers. They provide fast feedback on whether the proposed changes pass basic checks and tests.

### Gate Pipelines
- **Definition:** Gate pipelines in Zuul are responsible for running jobs that perform more thorough validation, including integration tests, deployment tests, and other critical tasks.
- **Purpose:** Gate pipelines serve as a gatekeeper for changes before they are merged into the main branch (typically the master branch). They enforce stricter criteria and ensure that changes meet quality standards and do not introduce regressions.

### True or False? Gate Pipelines Run After Check Pipelines
- **True:** Gate pipelines in Zuul are configured to run after the check pipelines. This sequencing ensures that changes first pass basic checks in the check pipelines before undergoing more rigorous testing in the gate pipelines.
- **Workflow:** The typical workflow involves:
  1. **Check Pipelines:** These pipelines provide initial feedback on proposed changes.
  2. **Gate Pipelines:** If changes pass the check pipelines, they proceed to the gate pipelines for more comprehensive testing.
  3. **Merge:** Changes that pass both check and gate pipelines are then eligible for merge into the main branch.

Zuul's approach with check and gate pipelines helps streamline the development process by allowing developers to receive quick feedback on their changes while maintaining high standards for code quality and reliability before integration into the main codebase.
