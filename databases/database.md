Sure, I can explain these concepts related to databases. Let's dive into each question:

1. **What type of databases are you familiar with?**
   - **SQL (Relational databases):** MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle Database, SQL Server, etc.
   - **NoSQL (Non-relational databases):** MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, DynamoDB, etc.
   - **NewSQL:** CockroachDB, Google Spanner, etc.

2. **What is a relational database?**
   - A relational database organizes data into tables (relations) where data points are stored in rows and columns. It uses structured query language (SQL) for querying and managing data.

3. **What does it mean when a database is ACID compliant?**
   - ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability:
     - **Atomicity:** All transactions are treated as atomic units, either fully completed or fully rolled back.
     - **Consistency:** Transactions bring the database from one valid state to another.
     - **Isolation:** Transactions are isolated from each other until they are completed.
     - **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, it will persist, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors.

4. **What is sharding?**
   - Sharding is a database partitioning technique where large datasets are divided into smaller, more manageable parts called shards. Each shard is stored on a separate database server instance to distribute load and improve query performance.

5. **You find out your database became a bottleneck and users experience issues accessing data. How can you deal with such a situation?**
   - Possible solutions include:
     - **Scaling Up:** Increasing resources (CPU, memory) on the current server.
     - **Scaling Out:** Adding more database servers (horizontal scaling).
     - **Query Optimization:** Tuning and optimizing queries, indexing, and schema design.
     - **Caching:** Implementing caching strategies to reduce database load.
     - **Sharding:** Partitioning data across multiple servers.
     - **Database Replication:** Creating read replicas to offload read operations.

6. **What is a connection pool?**
   - A connection pool is a cache of database connections maintained by the application server. It allows reusing existing database connections rather than creating a new connection each time a connection request is made, which improves performance and efficiency.

7. **What is a connection leak?**
   - A connection leak occurs when an application fails to close a database connection after use. This can lead to resource exhaustion and poor application performance due to the limited number of available connections.

8. **What is Table Lock?**
   - Table Lock is a database locking mechanism where a database table is locked to prevent other sessions from accessing or modifying its data concurrently. It ensures data integrity but can lead to performance bottlenecks in highly concurrent environments.

9. **Your database performs slower than usual. More specifically, your queries are taking a lot of time. What would you do?**
   - Steps to address slow queries include:
     - Analyzing query execution plans.
     - Adding or optimizing indexes.
     - Partitioning large tables.
     - Optimizing database configurations.
     - Tuning database parameters (buffer sizes, cache settings).
     - Analyzing and optimizing SQL queries.
     - Checking for hardware bottlenecks (CPU, memory, disk I/O).

10. **What is a Data Warehouse?**
    - A Data Warehouse is a centralized repository that stores structured, historical data from various sources within an organization. It is optimized for analytical queries and reporting rather than transactional processing.

11. **Explain what is a time-series database**
    - A time-series database is optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data points. It is designed for handling large volumes of time-series data generated from sensors, IoT devices, monitoring systems, and financial applications.

12. **What is OLTP (Online transaction processing)?**
    - OLTP is a database processing paradigm focused on managing and executing transactions in real-time. It supports frequent and short-lived transactions that involve inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.

13. **What is OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)?**
    - OLAP is a database processing paradigm that facilitates complex analysis of data for decision-making purposes. It involves querying and aggregating large datasets to discover trends, patterns, and relationships.

14. **What is an index in a database?**
    - An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional space and overhead during insert and update operations. Indexes are created on columns to accelerate query execution.

15. **What data types are there in relational databases?**
    - Common data types include:
      - **Numeric:** Integer, Decimal, Float, Double
      - **Character:** Char, Varchar, Text
      - **Date and Time:** Date, Time, Timestamp
      - **Boolean:** True/False

16. **Explain Normalization**
    - Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them to improve data integrity and reduce storage requirements.

17. **Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key**
    - **Primary Key:** A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It enforces entity integrity and ensures that each record can be uniquely identified.
    - **Foreign Key:** A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a link between two tables and enforces referential integrity constraints.

18. **What types of data tables have you used?**
    - I have used various types of tables including transactional tables (OLTP), analytical tables (OLAP), lookup tables, dimension tables, fact tables, and staging tables in relational databases.

19. **What is ORM? What benefits does it provide in regards to relational databases usage?**
    - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that converts data between incompatible type systems (object-oriented programming languages and relational databases). Benefits include:
      - Simplifying database interactions through high-level object-oriented APIs.
      - Reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed for CRUD operations.
      - Abstracting away differences between database systems.
      - Enabling faster development and maintenance of database-driven applications.

20. **What is DDL?**
    - DDL (Data Definition Language) is a subset of SQL used to define and manage database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints. DDL statements include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, and RENAME.

### Time Series

**21. What is a Time Series database?**
    - A Time Series database is optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data points. It is designed for handling large volumes of time-series data generated from sensors, IoT devices, monitoring systems, and financial applications.
