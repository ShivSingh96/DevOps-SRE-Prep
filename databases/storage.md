### Types of Storage

#### Types of Storage
1. **Object Storage**: Stores data as objects, typically in a flat structure with a unique identifier. It's ideal for unstructured data.
2. **File Storage**: Organizes data into files and folders with hierarchical directory structures.
3. **Block Storage**: Breaks data into blocks and stores them as separate pieces with unique identifiers. It's used in traditional storage area networks (SANs).
4. **Cloud Storage**: Storage provided as a service over the internet by cloud service providers.
5. **Network Attached Storage (NAS)**: Storage devices that connect to a network and provide storage to multiple clients simultaneously.
6. **Direct Attached Storage (DAS)**: Storage directly attached to a single server or computer.

### Object Storage

#### Object Storage
Object storage stores data as objects, where each object consists of data, metadata, and a unique identifier. It's typically used for unstructured data and provides a flat structure with no hierarchy.

#### Pros and Cons of Object Storage

**Pros**:
- **Scalability**: Scales horizontally with ease to handle large volumes of data.
- **Durability**: Provides high durability through data redundancy and replication.
- **Flexibility**: Supports diverse data types and formats.
- **Global Accessibility**: Accessible over the internet from anywhere.
- **Cost-Effective**: Usually cost-effective for storing large amounts of data.

**Cons**:
- **Limited Performance**: Can have higher latency compared to block storage for certain types of access patterns.
- **Complexity**: Managing metadata and unique identifiers can be complex.
- **Access Control**: Fine-grained access control can be more challenging compared to file or block storage.

#### Use Cases for Object Storage
- **Media Storage**: Storing videos, images, and audio files.
- **Backup and Archive**: Long-term data retention and backup storage.
- **Content Distribution**: Storing and distributing content for websites and applications.
- **Data Lakes**: Storing large amounts of diverse data for analytics and processing.

### File Storage

#### File Storage
File storage organizes data into files and folders with a hierarchical structure. It uses a filesystem to manage and retrieve data.

#### Pros and Cons of File Storage

**Pros**:
- **Ease of Use**: Familiar directory and file structure makes it easy to organize and manage data.
- **Sharing**: Allows multiple users or applications to access and modify shared files simultaneously.
- **Compatibility**: Compatible with many applications and operating systems.

**Cons**:
- **Scalability**: Scaling file storage can be more complex compared to object storage.
- **Performance**: May have performance limitations with large-scale or high-transaction workloads.
- **Management Overhead**: Requires more management overhead compared to object storage for large datasets.

#### Examples of File Storage
- **Network Attached Storage (NAS)**: Devices like NetApp, EMC Isilon.
- **Cloud File Storage**: Services like AWS EFS (Elastic File System), Azure Files, Google Cloud Filestore.
- **Traditional File Servers**: On-premises servers providing shared file storage.

### Storage Devices

#### Types of Storage Devices
1. **Hard Disk Drives (HDD)**: Uses spinning magnetic disks to store data.
2. **Solid State Drives (SSD)**: Uses flash memory to store data, providing faster access times than HDDs.
3. **Flash Drives**: Portable storage devices using flash memory.
4. **Cloud Storage**: Storage provided as a service by cloud providers.
5. **Tape Drives**: Sequential access storage used for backup and long-term storage.

### Storage Performance Metrics

#### IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)
IOPS measures the number of read and write operations a storage device or system can perform in one second. It indicates storage performance, especially for random access workloads.

#### Storage Throughput
Storage throughput measures the rate at which data can be read from or written to storage over a period of time. It indicates the overall data transfer rate of the storage system.

### Filesystem

#### Filesystem
A filesystem is a method used by operating systems to organize and store data on storage devices. It manages how data is stored, accessed, and retrieved by applications and users.

### Dark Data

#### Dark Data
Dark data refers to data that organizations collect, process, and store but do not use for any operational or analytical purposes. It remains unanalyzed or unused, often due to unknown value or lack of awareness.

### MBR (Master Boot Record)

#### MBR (Master Boot Record)
MBR is a special type of boot sector at the beginning of a storage device (like a hard drive) that contains information about how the partitions on the device are organized. It also includes the boot loader to start the operating system.
