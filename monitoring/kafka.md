### Kafka 101

**What is Kafka?**
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform originally developed by LinkedIn and now maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. It is designed to handle real-time data feeds with high throughput, scalability, and durability.

**What Kafka is used for?**
Kafka is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It allows applications to publish, subscribe to, store, and process streams of records (messages or events). Kafka is particularly useful in scenarios such as real-time analytics, log aggregation, monitoring data pipelines, and building microservices architectures.

**What is a "Producer" in regards to Kafka?**
In Kafka, a Producer is a component or application that publishes (produces) messages to Kafka topics. Messages are typically records containing data or events that are sent to a Kafka broker. Producers are responsible for selecting the topic to which the message should be published and ensuring that messages are delivered to Kafka with certain guarantees (e.g., at least once, exactly once).

### Kafka Architecture

**What's in a Kafka cluster?**
A Kafka cluster consists of multiple brokers (servers) that collectively manage and store Kafka topics. Each broker in the cluster manages a portion of the topic partitions and serves as a leader or follower for those partitions. Additionally, Kafka clusters rely on ZooKeeper for coordination and metadata management (though Kafka is moving away from this dependency in newer versions).

**What is the role of ZooKeeper in Kafka?**
ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services within a Kafka cluster. In Kafka, ZooKeeper is primarily used for managing and coordinating brokers and ensuring fault tolerance. It keeps track of broker liveness, maintains Kafka cluster metadata (e.g., topic configurations, partition assignments), and helps in leader election for partitions. However, starting from Kafka 2.8.0, ZooKeeper dependency is being deprecated in favor of Kafka's internal metadata management and coordination protocols.

Kafka's architecture enables fault tolerance, scalability, and high throughput by distributing and replicating data across brokers in a Kafka cluster. It supports horizontal scaling by adding more brokers to handle increased data ingestion and processing demands, making it a robust choice for building distributed streaming applications.
