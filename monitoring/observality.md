### Observability

**Observability** refers to the ability to infer the internal state of a system based on its external outputs. It involves gathering data from various sources within a system to understand how it behaves and performs. The concept originated in control theory but has been adapted to various fields, including software engineering and IT operations.

### Monitoring

**Monitoring** is the systematic process of collecting data about a system's health, performance, and behavior over time. It is a crucial component of observability because it provides the data necessary to understand and diagnose issues within a system.

### Relationship between Monitoring and Observability

- **Monitoring and Observability**: Monitoring provides the data points (metrics, logs, traces) that contribute to observability. Observability, on the other hand, encompasses the broader capability to analyze and derive insights from this data to understand system behavior comprehensively.

### Types of Monitoring Outputs

In IT and software engineering, common types of monitoring outputs include:

- **Metrics**: Quantitative measurements that provide insights into system performance (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, response times).
- **Logs**: Records of events and activities within a system, useful for troubleshooting and auditing.
- **Traces**: Captures the path of a request across distributed systems, helping to analyze performance and detect issues in microservices architectures.
- **Alerts**: Notifications triggered by predefined thresholds or conditions, indicating potential issues or anomalies.
- **Dashboards**: Visual representations of monitoring data, allowing for real-time tracking and analysis of key metrics.

### Data Monitored in the IT Industry

In the IT industry, various aspects are commonly monitored:

- **Infrastructure**: Servers, networks, storage devices, virtual machines, containers.
- **Applications**: Performance metrics, response times, error rates, resource utilization.
- **Security**: Intrusion attempts, access logs, anomalies in user behavior.
- **Databases**: Query performance, throughput, latency, connection pool usage.
- **User Experience**: Page load times, transaction completion rates, user interactions.

### Time Series Data

- **Time Series Data**: Data points indexed in chronological order, typically collected at regular intervals (e.g., every second, minute, hour). It's crucial for monitoring trends, patterns, and changes over time in system behavior.

### Data Aggregation

- **Data Aggregation**: Combining multiple data points into a single data point to summarize information. It helps reduce the volume of data for analysis and visualization while preserving essential information.

### Application Performance Management (APM)

**Application Performance Management (APM)** is the monitoring and management of the availability and performance of software applications. It involves:

- **Monitoring Application Performance**: Tracking response times, throughput, and resource consumption.
- **Identifying Issues**: Detecting errors, bottlenecks, and performance degradation.
- **End-User Experience**: Monitoring user interactions and response times to ensure optimal user experience.

### Aspects Monitored with APM

Three aspects of a project that can be monitored with APM include:

1. **Backend Services**: Performance of APIs, microservices, databases, and other backend components.
2. **Infrastructure**: Resource usage (CPU, memory, disk), network latency, and availability of servers and services.
3. **User Transactions**: Monitoring the flow of user requests through the application stack to identify slow response times or errors.

### Data Collected for APM Monitoring

To perform APM monitoring effectively, the following data can be collected and monitored:

- **Performance Metrics**: CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic.
- **Response Times**: End-to-end response times for requests processed by the application.
- **Error Rates**: Frequency and types of errors encountered by users or within the application.
- **Transaction Traces**: Detailed records of user interactions or API calls, including timings and dependencies.
- **Logs and Events**: Debugging information, audit logs, and application events for troubleshooting.

These aspects and data types collectively contribute to ensuring the reliability, availability, and performance of applications in production environments.
