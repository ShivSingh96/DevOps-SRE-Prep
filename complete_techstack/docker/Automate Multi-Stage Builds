#Scenario: Build a multi-stage Dockerfile for a Python application to optimize the image size.
# Stage 1: Build
FROM python:3.9 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Stage 2: Run
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
#Key Concepts: Multi-stage builds, image optimization.
