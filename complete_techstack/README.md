For a 7-year experience level in Cloud/DevOps, the coding questions will likely test your scripting skills for automation, infrastructure management, and troubleshooting. Here's how to prepare effectively:

---

### **Python Preparation**
1. **Core Concepts**:
   - Data structures: Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples.
   - File handling: Reading, writing, and parsing files (e.g., log files, JSON, YAML).
   - Exception handling: Writing robust scripts with proper error handling.
   - Functions: Writing reusable code with parameters and decorators.
   - Modules and libraries: `os`, `subprocess`, `shutil`, `json`, `yaml`, `argparse`.

2. **Cloud/DevOps-Specific Python Skills**:
   - **API Integration**: Use libraries like `requests` or `boto3` for interacting with cloud services.
   - **Automation**:
     - Write scripts to automate AWS/GCP/Azure tasks (e.g., spin up EC2, create S3 buckets).
     - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or Ansible combined with Python.
   - **Parsing and Transformation**:
     - Parse logs and configuration files (e.g., parse an Apache/Nginx log file).
     - Convert between formats like JSON, YAML, CSV, and XML.

3. **Practice Problems**:
   - Write a script to monitor disk usage and send an email alert if it exceeds a threshold.
   - Automate the backup of files from a server to an S3 bucket.
   - Parse a JSON file and extract specific information dynamically.

### **Shell Scripting Preparation**
1. **Core Concepts**:
   - File and string manipulation using `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, and `cut`.
   - Conditional statements and loops (`if`, `for`, `while`, `case`).
   - Process management: `ps`, `top`, `kill`, `bg`, `fg`.
   - Network utilities: `curl`, `wget`, `nc`, `ping`, `netstat`.
   - Handling user input and arguments (`$1`, `$2`, `getopts`).

2. **Cloud/DevOps-Specific Shell Skills**:
   - Automate tasks like service restarts, log rotation, and backups.
   - Write scripts to interact with cloud CLI tools (e.g., AWS CLI, GCloud CLI, az CLI).
   - Network troubleshooting: Analyze logs, monitor connections, and debug network issues.

3. **Practice Problems**:
   - Write a script to check if a process is running; if not, restart it and log the action.
   - Create a script to identify and delete files older than 30 days from a directory.
   - Write a script to fetch the IP address of a machine and verify its connectivity to specific endpoints.

### **Interview Coding Practice**
- **Python Questions**:
  1. Write a script to calculate the total size of all files in a given directory.
  2. Implement a simple HTTP client using the `requests` library.
  3. Parse a Kubernetes YAML file and extract all pod names.

- **Shell Scripting Questions**:
  1. Write a script to monitor CPU and memory usage and log them every 5 seconds.
  2. Automate log rotation (e.g., compress logs older than 7 days).
  3. Write a script to check whether specific ports are open on a list of servers.

### **Mock Scenarios**
1. **Python**:
   - Scenario: Automate the scaling of EC2 instances based on CPU utilization. Write a script to fetch metrics using the AWS SDK (`boto3`) and scale instances accordingly.
   - Scenario: Parse a Jenkins pipeline log and extract errors and warnings.

2. **Shell**:
   - Scenario: Automate database backups using a cron job, and write a script to notify via email on success/failure.
   - Scenario: Write a script to check if all nodes in a Nomad cluster are up and healthy.
