If you want to learn and remember things for longer, Just code it. 

Here are some of my examples : 

1. Don't just learn what is web server : Implement a WebServer from scratch : https://lnkd.in/gRF6ThSc 

2. Don't just read or watch video about Load Balancer : Implement a load balancer from scratch : https://lnkd.in/guWUVZUH 

3. Don't just read how DNS works : Run commands and actually see how nameservers and domain leveling works : https://lnkd.in/gDjcgdPF 

4. Don't just watch a fullstack development video : Implement your own CRUD web application with front-end and backend : https://lnkd.in/gnwbFN5A 

This is the only to remembers concepts for a long time and help yourself during interviews.
