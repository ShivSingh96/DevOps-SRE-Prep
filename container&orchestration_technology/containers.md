### Containers 101

**What is a Container?**
A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers isolate applications from their environment and ensure that they run consistently across different computing environments.

**Why containers are needed? What is their goal?**
Containers aim to provide a consistent, efficient, and portable way to package and run applications. Their primary goals include:

1. **Consistency**: Containers ensure that applications run consistently regardless of the environment, making them easier to deploy and manage.
   
2. **Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight because they share the host operating system's kernel and resources, enabling higher resource utilization and faster startup times compared to traditional virtual machines.
   
3. **Portability**: Containers can run seamlessly on any computing environment that supports containerization, from development laptops to production servers and cloud environments.

**What is a container image?**
A container image is a read-only template that contains all the necessary components to run a containerized application, including the application code, runtime environment, libraries, and dependencies. It serves as the basis for creating and running container instances.

**How are containers different from virtual machines (VMs)?**
Containers and VMs serve similar purposes of virtualizing computing resources, but they differ in several key aspects:

- **Resource Utilization**: Containers share the host operating system's kernel and use minimal resources compared to VMs, which each run their own operating system instance.
  
- **Isolation**: Containers provide process-level isolation, whereas VMs offer full isolation by virtualizing the hardware and running separate OS instances.
  
- **Performance**: Containers have lower overhead and faster startup times due to their lightweight nature, whereas VMs require more resources and time to boot.

**In which scenarios would you use containers and in which would you prefer to use VMs?**
- **Containers**: Ideal for microservices architectures, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), scaling applications horizontally, and building portable cloud-native applications.
  
- **VMs**: Preferred for running applications that require full isolation, legacy applications that cannot be containerized easily, complex applications needing diverse operating systems, and environments requiring strict security boundaries.

**Describe the process of containerizing an application**
Containerizing an application typically involves the following steps:

1. **Dockerfile Creation**: Write a Dockerfile that specifies the environment and dependencies needed by the application.
   
2. **Building the Image**: Use the Dockerfile to build a container image that packages the application along with its dependencies.
   
3. **Running the Container**: Instantiate a container from the built image using Docker or another container runtime platform.
   
4. **Testing and Optimization**: Test the containerized application to ensure it behaves as expected and optimize the Dockerfile and image for performance and size if necessary.
   
5. **Deployment**: Deploy the containerized application to your desired environment, such as a local development environment, cloud platform, or Kubernetes cluster.

**What are some of the advantages in using containers? Compare to other options like VMs**
- **Resource Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel and resources, leading to higher resource utilization and lower overhead compared to VMs.
  
- **Portability**: Containers can run consistently across different environments, reducing compatibility issues and easing application deployment.
  
- **Speed**: Containers typically have faster startup times and can be scaled more quickly compared to VMs, which improves agility in dynamic environments.
  
- **Consistency**: Containers ensure that applications behave consistently across development, testing, and production environments, enhancing reliability and simplifying troubleshooting.

Containers offer a modern approach to application deployment and management, providing developers and operators with tools to build, ship, and run applications efficiently in diverse computing environments.

To address your questions about running and managing containers using Podman or Docker, here are the answers:

1. **How to run a container?**
   - Using Podman: `podman run IMAGE_NAME [COMMAND]`
   - Using Docker: `docker run IMAGE_NAME [COMMAND]`

   Example:
   ```bash
   podman run ubuntu
   ```

2. **Why after running `podman container run ubuntu` the output of `podman container ls` is empty?**
   - The command `podman container ls` lists only running containers. If you run a container without `-d` (detached mode) or `--rm` (remove container after it exits), it starts the container, executes its command, and then stops. To see containers that have exited, you can use `podman container ls -a`.

3. **How to list all the containers on the local host?**
   - Using Podman: `podman container ls -a`
   - Using Docker: `docker container ls -a`

4. **How to attach your shell to a terminal of a running container?**
   - Using Podman: `podman exec -it CONTAINER_NAME /bin/bash`
   - Using Docker: `docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME /bin/bash`

5. **True or False? You can remove a running container if it doesn't running anything**
   - False. You cannot remove a running container unless you stop it first.

6. **How to stop and remove a container?**
   - Using Podman:
     ```bash
     podman stop CONTAINER_NAME
     podman rm CONTAINER_NAME
     ```
   - Using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker stop CONTAINER_NAME
     docker rm CONTAINER_NAME
     ```

7. **What happens when you run `docker container run ubuntu`?**
   - It starts a new container based on the `ubuntu` image, executes its default command (usually a shell), and then exits.

8. **How to run a container in the background?**
   - Using Podman: `podman run -d IMAGE_NAME [COMMAND]`
   - Using Docker: `docker run -d IMAGE_NAME [COMMAND]`

9. **If you'll run `sleep 100` inside a container, will you see it when listing all the processes of the host on which the container runs? Why?**
   - No, you will not see it. Containers provide process isolation, so processes inside the container are isolated from the host system.

10. **True or False? If image `httpd-service` has an entry point for running the `httpd` service then, the following will run the container and eventually the `httpd` service: `podman run httpd-service ls`**
    - False. The `ls` command overrides the default command of the `httpd-service` image. To start the `httpd` service, you would typically run `podman run httpd-service`, which executes the image's default entry point.

11. **True or False? Running `podman restart CONTAINER_NAME` kills the main process inside the container and runs it again from scratch**
    - True. `podman restart` stops the container, kills its main process, and then starts it again.

12. **You would like to run a web server inside a container but be able to access it from localhost. Demonstrate how to do that**
    - Use port mapping:
      ```bash
      podman run -d -p 8080:80 httpd
      ```
      This maps port 8080 of the host to port 80 of the container. You can then access the web server running inside the container at `http://localhost:8080`.

13. **After running a container, it stopped. `podman ps` shows nothing. How can you show its details?**
    - Use `podman ps -a` to show all containers, including stopped ones:
      ```bash
      podman ps -a
      ```

14. **How to list all the image tags for a given container image?**
    - Using Podman:
      ```bash
      podman image tags IMAGE_NAME
      ```
    - Using Docker:
      ```bash
      docker image ls IMAGE_NAME
      ```

These commands and explanations should help you effectively manage and work with containers using Podman or Docker.

Let's address your questions about container images:

1. **Why container images are relatively small?**
   - Container images are designed to be small and efficient because they typically contain only the necessary components required to run an application. They leverage layers and file system optimizations to reduce size.

2. **You are interested in running a container with a snake game application. How can you search for such image and check if it exists?**
   - You can search for container images on Docker Hub or other container registries using keywords like "snake game". For example, you can use:
     ```bash
     docker search snake game
     ```

3. **How to list the container images on a certain host?**
   - Using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker image ls
     ```

4. **How to download/pull a container image without actually running a container?**
   - Using Docker:
     ```bash
     docker pull IMAGE_NAME
     ```

5. **True or False? It's not possible to remove an image if a certain container is using it**
   - True. You cannot remove an image that is being used by a running container. You need to stop and remove the container first.

6. **True or False? If a tag isn't specified when pulling an image, the 'latest' tag is being used**
   - True. If you don't specify a tag when pulling an image, Docker (and many container registries) default to pulling the 'latest' tag.

7. **True or False? Using the 'latest' tag when pulling an image means you are pulling the most recently published image**
   - True. The 'latest' tag points to the most recent version of an image published in the registry.

8. **Where pulled images are stored?**
   - Pulled images are stored in Docker's image cache, typically located in `/var/lib/docker` directory on Linux hosts.

9. **Explain container image layers**
   - Container images are composed of multiple read-only layers. Each layer represents a filesystem change, such as adding or modifying files. Layers are stacked together to form the complete image.

10. **True or False? Changing the content of any of the image layers will cause the hash content of the image to change**
    - True. Any modification to an image layer results in a new image hash because the layer's content is immutable once created.

11. **How to list the layers of an image?**
    - Using Docker:
      ```bash
      docker history IMAGE_NAME
      ```

12. **True or False? In most cases, container images contain their own kernel**
    - False. Container images do not typically contain their own kernel. They share the host system's kernel, which makes them lightweight and efficient.

13. **True or False? A single container image can have multiple tags**
    - True. Multiple tags can point to the same image ID, allowing different versions or aliases to be accessed.

14. **What is a dangling image?**
    - A dangling image is an unused image that is not tagged and not referenced by any container. These images can accumulate over time and take up disk space.

15. **How to see changes done to a given image over time?**
    - You can inspect the history of an image using:
      ```bash
      docker history IMAGE_NAME
      ```

16. **What `docker commit` does? When will you use it?**
    - `docker commit` creates a new image from changes to a container's file system. It's typically used for creating custom images from modified containers or for experimenting with new software configurations.

17. **True or False? Multiple images can share layers**
    - True. Docker and other container runtimes use layer caching and sharing to optimize storage and speed up image pulls.

18. **What is the digest of an image? What problem does it solve?**
    - An image digest is a hash generated from the image's content. It uniquely identifies the image regardless of its tag. It ensures image integrity and allows for secure verification when pulling images.

19. **True or False? A single image can support multiple architectures (Linux x64, Windows x64, ...)**
    - True. Multi-architecture images support different CPU architectures and operating systems within the same image repository.

20. **What is a distribution hash in regards to layers?**
    - The distribution hash refers to the hash of each layer within the container image. It ensures consistency and integrity when pulling and verifying image layers from registries.

21. **How multi-architecture images work? Explain by describing what happens when an image is pulled**
    - When pulling a multi-architecture image, the container runtime detects the host's architecture and pulls the corresponding image layer. Images are stored in a manifest that lists supported architectures and points to architecture-specific layers.

22. **How to check which architectures a certain container image supports?**
    - You can inspect the manifest of a container image to see supported architectures:
      ```bash
      docker manifest inspect IMAGE_NAME
      ```

23. **How to check what a certain container image will execute once we'll run a container based on that image?**
    - You can view the default command or entry point of an image using:
      ```bash
      docker inspect --format='{{.Config.Cmd}}' IMAGE_NAME
      docker inspect --format='{{.Config.Entrypoint}}' IMAGE_NAME
      ```

24. **How to view the instructions that were used to build an image?**
    - Dockerfile instructions are embedded in the image metadata. To view them:
      ```bash
      docker history --no-trunc IMAGE_NAME
      ```

25. **How `docker image build` works?**
    - `docker image build` reads instructions from a Dockerfile, executes those instructions step-by-step to create layers, and packages them into a container image.

26. **What is the role of cache in image builds?**
    - Cache in Docker image builds improves build speed by storing intermediate results of executed instructions. It reuses cached layers unless the Dockerfile instructions change.

27. **How to remove an image from the host?**
    - Using Docker:
      ```bash
      docker rmi IMAGE_NAME
      ```

28. **What ways are there to reduce container image size?**
    - Some ways to reduce image size include using multi-stage builds, removing unnecessary files, using smaller base images, and optimizing Dockerfile instructions.

29. **What are the pros and cons of squashing images?**
    - **Pros:** Reduced image size, cleaner history, and fewer layers. **Cons:** Loss of layer caching benefits, increased build times, and potential loss of granularity in image versioning.

30. **You would like to share an image with another developer, but without using a registry. How would you do it?**
    - Save the image as a tar archive:
      ```bash
      docker save -o IMAGE_NAME.tar IMAGE_NAME
      ```
    - Share the `IMAGE_NAME.tar` file with the developer, who can then load it:
      ```bash
      docker load -i IMAGE_NAME.tar
      ```

31. **True or False? Once a container is stopped and removed, its image is also removed from the host**
    - False. Stopping and removing a container does not automatically remove its associated image unless it's explicitly removed.

32. **How to find out which files were added to the container image filesystem?**
    - You can compare the filesystem before and after building an image to see added files:
      ```bash
      docker diff CONTAINER_NAME
      ```

33. **True or False? `docker diff` works only on the container filesystem and not mounted files**
    - True. `docker diff` only shows changes to the container's filesystem, not to mounted volumes.

34. **How the centralized location, where images are stored, is called?**
    - It's called a container registry, such as Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, or a private registry.

These answers should give you a comprehensive overview of container images, how they work, and how to manage them using Docker.

### Registry

1. **What is a Registry?**
   - A registry is a storage and distribution system for container images. It stores Docker images and allows users to pull, push, and manage container images.

2. **A registry contains one or more ____ which in turn contain one or more ____**
   - A registry contains one or more **repositories** which in turn contain one or more **tags**.

3. **How to find out which registry do you use by default from your environment?**
   - To find out which registry is configured as default in your environment, you can check the Docker configuration:
     ```bash
     docker info | grep -i registry
     ```

4. **How to configure registries with the container engine you are using?**
   - Registry configuration is typically managed through the Docker or container engine configuration file (`config.json`). You can edit this file directly or use commands to manage registries.
     - **Edit `config.json`:** Directly edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json` (Linux) or `C:\ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json` (Windows) to add or modify registry configurations.
     - **Using Docker commands:** For example, to add a registry:
       ```bash
       docker login REGISTRY_URL
       ```
       This command prompts for credentials and adds the registry to the Docker configuration.

5. **How to retrieve the latest Ubuntu image?**
   - To pull the latest Ubuntu image from Docker Hub:
     ```bash
     docker pull ubuntu
     ```

6. **How to push an image to a registry?**
   - Assuming you have an image tagged with a registry path:
     ```bash
     docker tag IMAGE_NAME REGISTRY_URL/IMAGE_NAME:TAG
     docker push REGISTRY_URL/IMAGE_NAME:TAG
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     docker tag myimage myregistry.com/myimage:v1
     docker push myregistry.com/myimage:v1
     ```

7. **What are some best practices in regards to Container Images?**
   - **Use minimal base images:** Start with minimal base images to reduce size and attack surface.
   - **Avoid unnecessary components:** Remove unnecessary files and dependencies.
   - **Use multi-stage builds:** Use multi-stage builds to keep the final image size small.
   - **Tag appropriately:** Use meaningful tags and versioning to manage image versions.
   - **Scan for vulnerabilities:** Use tools to scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment.

8. **What ways are there for creating new images?**
   - There are several ways to create new container images:
     - **Dockerfile:** Create images using declarative instructions in a Dockerfile.
     - **Committing changes:** Make changes to a running container and commit them to a new image.
     - **Using build tools:** Use build tools like Buildah, Kaniko, or Docker Build to automate image creation.
     - **Layering:** Combine multiple base images or layers into a single image using techniques like multi-stage builds.

These answers cover the basics of container registries, their configuration, and best practices for managing container images. If you have more specific questions or need further details, feel free to ask!

### Tags

1. **What are image tags? Why is it recommended to use tags when supporting multiple releases/versions of a project?**

   - **Image tags** are labels attached to container images that denote a specific version, release, or variant of the image. They allow users to easily reference and manage different versions of the same image.
   - It is recommended to use tags when supporting multiple releases or versions of a project because:
     - **Versioning:** Tags help distinguish different versions of the same image. For example, `v1`, `v2`, `latest`.
     - **Reproducibility:** Tags ensure that the same image version can be consistently deployed across different environments.
     - **Rollbacks:** Tags facilitate rolling back to a previous version if a newer version introduces issues.
     - **Testing and Development:** Tags support testing and development workflows by providing controlled environments with specific versions.

2. **How to tag an image?**

   - To tag an existing Docker image, you use the `docker tag` command:
     ```bash
     docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]
     ```
     - `SOURCE_IMAGE`: The existing image name (optionally with a tag).
     - `TARGET_IMAGE`: The new image name and optional tag.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       docker tag myimage:latest myregistry.com/myimage:v1
       ```

3. **True or False? Once created, it's impossible to remove a tag for a certain image**

   - **False**. Tags can be deleted or overwritten. You can remove a tag using the `docker rmi` command:
     ```bash
     docker rmi IMAGE_NAME:TAG
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     docker rmi myregistry.com/myimage:v1
     ```

4. **True or False? Multiple tags can reference the same image**

   - **True**. Multiple tags can point to the same image. This is useful for maintaining different versions or aliases of an image without duplicating the image itself.

These answers should clarify the concept of image tags and how they are managed in Docker. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

### Containerfile/Dockerfile

1. **What is a Containerfile/Dockerfile?**
   - A **Containerfile** or **Dockerfile** is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using a Dockerfile, you can automate the steps required to create a Docker image.

2. **What instruction exists in every Containerfile/Dockerfile and what does it do?**
   - The `FROM` instruction is required in every Dockerfile. It specifies the base image to use for the Docker image being built. Example: `FROM ubuntu:20.04`

3. **List five different instructions that are available for use in a Containerfile/Dockerfile:**
   - `FROM`: Specifies the base image.
   - `RUN`: Executes commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the results.
   - `COPY`: Copies files and directories from a source to a destination in the image's filesystem.
   - `ADD`: Copies files, directories, or remote URLs to the image, with additional support for extracting compressed files.
   - `CMD`: Specifies the command to run when the container starts (often overridden by a command passed at runtime).

4. **What are some of the best practices regarding Containerfiles/Dockerfiles that you are following?**
   - Use a minimal base image.
   - Combine `RUN` commands to reduce the number of layers.
   - Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files from the build context.
   - Specify tags explicitly for reproducibility (`FROM ubuntu:20.04` instead of `FROM ubuntu`).
   - Avoid installing unnecessary packages or dependencies.

5. **What is the "build context"?**
   - The **build context** is the set of files located in the current directory from which the Dockerfile is executed. It includes all files and directories recursively, except those excluded by `.dockerignore`.

6. **What is the difference between ADD and COPY in Containerfile/Dockerfile?**
   - Both `ADD` and `COPY` copy files into the Docker image, but `ADD` has additional features:
     - Supports URLs and automatically extracts compressed files.
     - Should be avoided unless these additional features are necessary, to keep operations predictable.

7. **What is the difference between CMD and RUN in Containerfile/Dockerfile?**
   - `RUN` executes commands during the build of the image to make changes to the image's filesystem. It creates new layers.
   - `CMD` specifies the command to run when a container is started from the image. It can be overridden by specifying a command at runtime.

8. **How to create a new image using a Containerfile/Dockerfile?**
   - Use the `docker build` command:
     ```bash
     docker build -t IMAGE_NAME:TAG PATH_TO_DOCKERFILE_DIRECTORY
     ```

9. **Do you perform any checks or testing on your Containerfiles/Dockerfiles?**
   - Yes, it's recommended to lint Dockerfiles to check for syntax errors and adherence to best practices. Tools like `hadolint` or Docker's own `docker lint` can be used.

10. **Which instructions in Containerfile/Dockerfile create new layers?**
    - `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD` instructions create new layers in the Docker image.

11. **Which instructions in Containerfile/Dockerfile create image metadata and don't create new layers?**
    - `LABEL`, `EXPOSE`, `ENV`, `WORKDIR`, `ENTRYPOINT` instructions create image metadata and don't create new layers.

12. **Is it possible to identify which instruction creates a new layer from the output of `podman image history`?**
    - Yes, each instruction in the `podman image history` output typically corresponds to a new layer, starting with the `FROM` instruction.

13. **True or False? Each Containerfile instruction runs in an independent container using an image built from every previous layer/entry.**
    - **False**. Each instruction in a Dockerfile runs in a new layer on top of the current image state, not in a new container.

14. **What's the difference between these two forms:**
    ```dockerfile
    ENTRYPOINT ["cmd", "param0", "param1"]
    CMD ["param0"]
    ```
    ```dockerfile
    ENTRYPOINT cmd param0 param1
    CMD param0
    ```
    - The first form (`ENTRYPOINT ["cmd", "param0", "param1"]`) specifies the executable and its arguments that are run when the container starts. The `CMD ["param0"]` provides default arguments to the `ENTRYPOINT`.
    - The second form (`ENTRYPOINT cmd param0 param1` and `CMD param0`) is a shell form where the `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` are combined into a single command. The `CMD` still provides default arguments.

15. **Containerfile/Dockerfile can contain more than one `ENTRYPOINT` instruction and one `CMD` instruction**
    - **False**. A Dockerfile can have only one `CMD` instruction and one `ENTRYPOINT` instruction, but they can be specified in different forms.

16. **What happens when `CMD` instruction is defined but not an `ENTRYPOINT` instruction in a Containerfile/Dockerfile?**
    - If `CMD` is defined without an `ENTRYPOINT`, the `CMD` instruction specifies the command to run when a container is started without specifying a command at runtime. It is often overridden by specifying a command explicitly when running the container.

17. **In the case of running `podman run -it IMAGE ls` the `ls` overrides the ___ instruction**
    - The `CMD` instruction. When you specify a command (e.g., `ls`) at runtime with `podman run`, it overrides the `CMD` instruction defined in the Dockerfile.

These answers provide a comprehensive overview of Dockerfile/Containerfile concepts and practices. If you have more questions or need further clarification on any topic, feel free to ask!

### Storage

1. **Container storage is said to be ephemeral. What does it mean?**
   - **Ephemeral** means temporary or short-lived. In the context of containers, it means that the storage within a container is not designed for persistence. Any data written to the container's file system or storage is typically lost when the container stops or is removed.

2. **True or False? Applications running on containers should use the container storage to store persistent data.**
   - **False**. Applications running in containers should not rely on container storage for persistent data because container storage is ephemeral. Instead, persistent data should be stored outside the container, such as in external volumes or databases.

3. **You stopped a running container but it still uses the storage in case you ever resume it. How to reclaim the storage of a container?**
   - To reclaim the storage of a stopped container, you should remove the container using the `docker rm` or `podman rm` command. This deletes the container and its associated storage. Example:
     ```bash
     docker rm CONTAINER_ID
     ```

4. **How to create a new volume?**
   - In Docker or Podman, you can create a new volume using the `docker volume create` or `podman volume create` command. Example:
     ```bash
     docker volume create myvolume
     ```
     This command creates a new Docker volume named `myvolume`.

5. **How to mount a directory from the host to a container?**
   - To mount a directory from the host into a container, you use the `-v` (volume) or `--mount` flag with the `docker run` or `podman run` command. Example:
     ```bash
     docker run -v /host/path:/container/path IMAGE_NAME
     ```
     This mounts the `/host/path` directory on the host to `/container/path` inside the container.

These answers cover the basics of container storage, volumes, and mounting directories. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

### Architecture

1. **How do containers achieve isolation from the rest of the system?**
   - Containers achieve isolation primarily through two key Linux kernel features: namespaces and control groups (cgroups). 
     - **Namespaces** provide isolation for various system resources such as process IDs (`pid`), network interfaces (`net`), filesystem mounts (`mnt`), and more. Each container has its own set of namespaces, making it appear to the processes inside the container that they have their own isolated instance of these resources.
     - **Control groups (cgroups)** manage and limit the resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of processes within a container. Cgroups ensure that containers cannot consume more resources than allocated, thereby providing resource isolation.

2. **Describe in detail what happens when you run `podman/docker run hello-world`?**
   - When you run `podman/docker run hello-world`:
     - The container runtime (`podman` or `docker`) first checks if the `hello-world` image is available locally.
     - If the image is not found locally, the runtime pulls it from the configured registry (like Docker Hub).
     - Once the image is available locally, the runtime creates a new container instance based on the image's configuration.
     - Namespaces and cgroups are used to isolate the container's processes and resources from the host and other containers.
     - The container's entry point (specified in the Dockerfile or image metadata) is executed, which in the case of `hello-world` typically prints a message.
     - After the process in the container (in this case, printing the message) completes, the container exits unless it's designed to remain running (`--rm` flag removes the container after it exits).

3. **Describe the difference between cgroups and namespaces:**
   - **Namespaces:** Provide process isolation by virtualizing system resources so that each container has its own view of the system (PID, network, filesystem, etc.).
   - **Control Groups (cgroups):** Manage and limit resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of processes within a container. Cgroups ensure fair resource allocation and prevent resource hogging by containers.

4. **Which of the following are Linux features that containers use?**
   - Among the options listed, the Linux features that containers use are:
     - Namespaces
     - Control Groups (cgroups)
     - SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) can also be used to enhance container security, but it's not a core feature like namespaces and cgroups.

5. **True or False? Containers have an ephemeral storage layer.**
   - **True**. Containers typically have an ephemeral storage layer, meaning any changes made to the container's filesystem while it's running are not persisted beyond the container's lifecycle. To persist data, containers often use external volumes or databases.

These answers provide an overview of how containers achieve isolation, the steps involved in running a container, the differences between namespaces and cgroups, essential Linux features for containers, and the ephemeral nature of container storage. If you have more questions or need further details, feel free to ask!

### Docker Architecture

1. **Which components/layers compose the Docker technology?**
   - Docker technology comprises several components:
     - Docker Engine (dockerd, containerd, runc)
     - Docker Client (docker)
     - Docker Registry (Docker Hub, private registries)
     - Docker Compose (for multi-container application orchestration)
     - Docker Swarm (for container clustering and orchestration, deprecated in favor of Kubernetes)
   
2. **What components are part of the Docker engine?**
   - The Docker Engine includes:
     - **dockerd:** The Docker daemon, which manages Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes.
     - **containerd:** Handles container execution and supervision, acting as the interface between dockerd and the Linux kernel (`runc` is used to run containers).
     - **runc:** A low-level runtime responsible for running containers based on OCI specifications.

3. **What is the low-level runtime?**
   - The low-level runtime in Docker refers to `runc`, which is responsible for executing containers based on OCI (Open Container Initiative) specifications. It interacts directly with the Linux kernel to set up namespaces and control groups for container isolation.

4. **What is the high-level runtime?**
   - The high-level runtime typically refers to `containerd`. While `runc` handles the low-level details of starting containers, `containerd` manages container lifecycle, image management, and distribution. It provides a more abstracted and manageable interface for Docker and other container runtimes.

5. **True or False? The docker daemon (dockerd) performs lower-level tasks compared to containerd.**
   - **False.** `containerd` performs lower-level container tasks (like executing containers via `runc`) compared to `dockerd`, which orchestrates higher-level Docker operations such as managing networks, volumes, and the Docker API.

### Docker Operations

6. **Describe in detail what happens when you run `docker pull image:tag`?**
   - When you run `docker pull image:tag`:
     - The Docker client (`docker`) sends a request to the Docker daemon (`dockerd`).
     - `dockerd` checks if the requested image (`image:tag`) exists locally.
     - If not found locally, `dockerd` communicates with the Docker Registry (like Docker Hub) to fetch the specified image.
     - The image layers are downloaded incrementally, starting from the base layers up to the specified tag.
     - Once downloaded, the image is stored locally in the Docker host's image cache.

7. **Describe in detail what happens when you run a container.**
   - When you run a container with `docker run image:tag`:
     - `docker` client sends a run command to `dockerd`.
     - `dockerd` checks if the specified image (`image:tag`) exists locally; if not, it pulls it from the registry.
     - `dockerd` creates a container based on the image, applying any specified options (like ports mapping, volumes, environment variables).
     - `containerd` (via `runc`) sets up namespaces and cgroups for isolation and starts the container's main process.
     - The container executes its defined command or entry point.
     - Output from the container's process is streamed back to the Docker client unless `-d` (detach) is used to run the container in the background.

8. **True or False? Killing the Docker daemon will kill all the running containers.**
   - **True.** The Docker daemon (`dockerd`) manages the lifecycle of containers. Killing `dockerd` will terminate all containers managed by it.

9. **True or False? containerd forks a new instance runc for every container it creates.**
   - **False.** `containerd` reuses the `runc` instance across multiple containers to optimize resource usage and container startup times.

10. **True or False? Running a dozen of containers will result in having a dozen of runc processes.**
    - **False.** `runc` is not forked for each container; instead, it manages multiple containers within the same process.

### Miscellaneous Docker Concepts

11. **What is shim in regards to Docker?**
    - In Docker, a "shim" is a lightweight intermediary process that facilitates communication between `dockerd` and `containerd`. It helps manage the lifecycle of containers more efficiently.

12. **How would you transfer data from one container into another?**
    - Data can be transferred between containers using shared volumes. Mount a volume from one container into another to exchange files or data.

13. **What happens to data of the container when a container exits?**
    - By default, data within a container is ephemeral. When a container exits, any changes made to its filesystem are lost. Use volumes to persist data beyond container lifecycles.

14. **How do you remove old, non-running containers?**
    - Use `docker container prune` to remove all stopped containers or `docker rm <container_id>` to remove a specific container.

15. **How does the Docker client communicate with the daemon?**
    - The Docker client (`docker`) communicates with the Docker daemon (`dockerd`) via a REST API over Unix sockets (`/var/run/docker.sock` by default) or TCP sockets.

16. **Explain Docker interlock.**
    - Docker Interlock is an old tool for automating container orchestration and load balancing in Docker Swarm. It's now deprecated in favor of Docker Swarm mode and Kubernetes for container orchestration.

17. **What is a Docker Repository?**
    - A Docker Repository is a collection of Docker images, usually organized under a common name or namespace. It can be public (like Docker Hub) or private (self-hosted or through other registries).

18. **Explain image layers.**
    - Docker images are composed of multiple layers. Each layer represents a filesystem change (like adding files, modifying files, etc.). Layers are stacked on top of each other to form the complete image.

19. **What best practices are you familiar related to working with containers?**
    - Best practices include using minimal base images, leveraging multi-stage builds, optimizing image size, using environment variables for configuration, and managing secrets securely.

20. **How do you manage persistent storage in Docker?**
    - Persistent storage in Docker can be managed using Docker volumes or bind mounts. Volumes are preferred for stateful applications as they persist data beyond container lifecycles.

21. **How can you connect from the inside of your container to the localhost of your host, where the container runs?**
    - Use `host.docker.internal` (for Docker Desktop) or the host IP (on Linux) to connect from inside a container to services running on the host's localhost.

22. **How do you copy files from a Docker container to the host and vice versa?**
    - Use `docker cp` command to copy files between a container and the Docker host. For example, `docker cp <container_id>:<src_path> <dest_path>` to copy from container to host.

These answers provide insights into Docker architecture, operations, concepts like image layers and repositories, and best practices for working with containers. If you have more questions or need further details, feel free to ask!

### Docker Compose

**1. Explain what is Docker Compose and what is it used for?**

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file (usually named `docker-compose.yml`) to configure the application's services, networks, and volumes. Docker Compose allows developers to define a complex application environment consisting of multiple interconnected services, all managed as a single unit.

**2. Describe the process of using Docker Compose**

Using Docker Compose typically involves the following steps:

- **Write a `docker-compose.yml` file:** Define the services, networks, and volumes required for your application. Specify each service's image, ports, volumes, environment variables, and other configurations.

- **Build or pull images:** If the images specified in `docker-compose.yml` are not already built or available locally, Docker Compose can build them using `docker-compose build` or pull them from a registry using `docker-compose pull`.

- **Start the application:** Use `docker-compose up` to start the application defined in `docker-compose.yml`. This command creates and starts containers for all services defined in the YAML file.

- **Manage the application:** Docker Compose provides commands to manage the lifecycle of the application:
  - `docker-compose ps`: Lists running services.
  - `docker-compose logs`: Displays log output from services.
  - `docker-compose down`: Stops and removes containers, networks, volumes created by `up`.

- **Scale services:** You can scale services defined in `docker-compose.yml` using the `--scale` option with `docker-compose up`, e.g., `docker-compose up --scale web=3` to run three instances of the `web` service.

**3. Explain Multi-stage builds**

Multi-stage builds in Docker allow you to use multiple `FROM` statements in a Dockerfile. Each `FROM` instruction begins a new stage in the Docker build, creating intermediate images that can be used to build artifacts and then copy those artifacts into the final image. This approach helps to optimize the size of the final image by discarding unnecessary build dependencies.

**4. True or False? In multi-stage builds, artifacts can be copied between stages**

**True.** In multi-stage builds, you can use `COPY --from=<stage_name>` to copy artifacts or files from one stage to another. This enables you to build components or compile code in one stage and then use only the necessary artifacts in subsequent stages, reducing the size of the final image.

**5. What `.dockerignore` is used for?**

`.dockerignore` is a file similar to `.gitignore` that specifies files and directories that should be excluded from the Docker build context when building images using Docker. It helps to speed up the build process and reduces the size of the final Docker image by omitting unnecessary files from being copied into the image.

### Networking

**What container network standards or architectures are you familiar with?**

Container networking in Docker and Kubernetes typically involves several standards and architectures:

- **Bridge Network:** The default network created when Docker is installed. It provides isolation between containers on the same host.

- **Host Network:** Containers share the network namespace with the host. This can improve networking performance but reduces isolation.

- **Overlay Network:** Used in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for multi-host communication. It allows containers across different hosts to communicate as if they were on the same network.

- **Macvlan Network:** Assigns a MAC address to each container, making it appear as a physical device on the network.

- **CNI (Container Networking Interface):** Used by Kubernetes to provide networking capabilities to containers. It supports various plugins for network configuration.

- **Service Mesh (e.g., Istio):** Provides advanced networking features like load balancing, traffic management, and security for microservices within Kubernetes or Docker environments.

Understanding these networking architectures helps in configuring Docker and Kubernetes environments to ensure efficient communication and isolation between containers and services. If you have more specific questions or need further details, feel free to ask!

### Docker Networking

**1. What network specification Docker is using and how its implementation is called?**

Docker uses the Container Network Model (CNM) for its networking implementation.

**2. Explain the following blocks in regards to CNM: Networks, Endpoints, Sandboxes**

- **Networks:** Networks in CNM are isolated communication environments where containers can connect to each other and to the outside world. They provide the scope for defining IP addressing, DNS settings, and other network configurations.

- **Endpoints:** Endpoints are virtual network interfaces within a network that connect containers to that network. Each container connected to a network has its own endpoint, which manages the container's network configuration within that network.

- **Sandboxes:** Sandboxes are virtual environments where containers' network interfaces are created and managed. They provide a layer of abstraction between containers and the physical network, ensuring isolation and security.

**3. True or False? If you would like to connect a container to multiple networks, you need multiple endpoints**

**True.** Each network connection requires a separate endpoint for the container. Therefore, if you want a container to communicate on multiple networks, it needs to have multiple endpoints, each corresponding to a different network.

**4. What are some features of libnetwork?**

Libnetwork is Docker's networking library that implements the CNM. Some features of libnetwork include:

- **Multi-host networking:** Supports overlay networks that span across multiple Docker hosts.
  
- **Network drivers:** Extensible framework with support for various network drivers, allowing integration with different network technologies (e.g., bridge, overlay, macvlan).

- **Network isolation:** Provides network isolation between containers and services, ensuring that traffic is segregated based on network configurations.

- **Service discovery:** Allows containers to discover and communicate with each other using service names rather than IP addresses, facilitating dynamic service discovery in microservices architectures.

### Security

**1. What security best practices are there regarding containers?**

Some security best practices for containers include:

- **Use minimal base images:** Start with lightweight and secure base images to minimize attack surfaces.
  
- **Apply least privilege:** Restrict container capabilities and permissions to only what's necessary for the application to run.
  
- **Update regularly:** Keep container images and underlying host systems updated with security patches and fixes.
  
- **Use secrets management:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in images; instead, use secrets management tools to inject secrets at runtime.
  
- **Implement network segmentation:** Use Docker networking features to segment containers and control traffic flow between them.
  
- **Monitor container activity:** Implement logging and monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activities or anomalies.

**2. A container can cause a kernel panic and bring down the whole host. What preventive actions can you apply to avoid this specific situation?**

To prevent a container from causing a kernel panic and affecting the entire host system, consider the following actions:

- **Resource limits:** Use Docker resource constraints (CPU, memory limits) to prevent containers from consuming excessive resources that could lead to system instability.
  
- **Isolate critical workloads:** Separate critical containers from less critical ones by using different Docker hosts or virtual machines.
  
- **Update kernel and Docker:** Ensure both the host's kernel and Docker are up to date with the latest security patches and stability fixes.
  
- **Monitor kernel logs:** Regularly monitor kernel logs and Docker container logs for any signs of instability or unexpected behavior.
  
- **Use container orchestration:** Implement container orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to manage and distribute workloads across multiple hosts, reducing the impact of a single container failure.

Implementing these practices helps to mitigate risks associated with containerized applications and ensures the stability and security of the underlying host systems. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

### Docker in Production

**1. What are some best practices you follow in regards to using containers in production?**

Some best practices for using Docker containers in production include:

- **Use of minimal base images:** Start with lightweight and secure base images to reduce attack surface and minimize vulnerabilities.
  
- **Implement resource limits:** Set CPU and memory limits for containers to prevent resource contention and ensure predictable performance.
  
- **Regular updates:** Keep Docker engine, container images, and host systems updated with the latest security patches and bug fixes.
  
- **Implement security measures:** Use secrets management, network segmentation, and container isolation to enhance security.
  
- **Monitoring and logging:** Implement monitoring tools to monitor container health, performance metrics, and logs for troubleshooting and security auditing.
  
- **Backup and disaster recovery:** Establish backup procedures for critical data within containers and ensure disaster recovery plans are in place.

**2. True or False? It's recommended for production environments that Docker client and server will communicate over network using HTTP socket**

**False.** For production environments, it's recommended to use secure communication between Docker client and server using HTTPS (TLS) instead of HTTP. This ensures encryption of data transmitted between Docker client and server, preventing interception and tampering.

**3. What forms of self-healing options are available for Docker containers?**

Docker containers can utilize several self-healing options:

- **Restart policies:** Docker provides restart policies that dictate how containers should behave when they exit. These policies include `no`, `always`, `on-failure`, and `unless-stopped`, which help in automatically restarting containers based on specific conditions.
  
- **Health checks:** Implementing health checks within Dockerfiles or Docker Compose files allows Docker to monitor the health of containers. Containers can be restarted automatically if they fail health checks.
  
- **Orchestration platforms:** Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm offer built-in mechanisms for self-healing. They monitor containers and automatically restart or reschedule them on healthy nodes if failures occur.

**4. What restart policies are you familiar with?**

Docker provides several restart policies that dictate how containers should be restarted when they exit:

- **`no`:** Do not automatically restart the container. This is the default behavior.
  
- **`always`:** Always restart the container regardless of the exit status.
  
- **`on-failure`:** Restart the container only if it exits with a non-zero exit status (indicating a failure).
  
- **`unless-stopped`:** Always restart the container unless it is explicitly stopped by the user.

### Rootless Containers

**1. Explain Rootless Containers**

Rootless containers are containers that can be run by non-root users without requiring escalated privileges. They aim to improve security by reducing the attack surface and minimizing the impact of container vulnerabilities.

**2. Are there disadvantages in running rootless containers?**

While rootless containers enhance security, they also come with some disadvantages:

- **Limited capabilities:** Rootless containers may have restricted access to certain system resources and capabilities, which can affect application functionality.
  
- **Compatibility issues:** Some Docker features or container configurations may not be fully supported or may require additional setup when running in rootless mode.
  
- **Performance overhead:** Running containers without root privileges may introduce performance overhead due to additional layers of security and isolation.

**3. Give one example of how rootless containers are more safe from a security perspective**

Rootless containers prevent containers from having direct access to the host system's resources and kernel, reducing the risk of privilege escalation attacks. For example, a compromised rootless container would have limited capabilities to affect other containers or the host system compared to a compromised container running as root.

**4. When running a container, usually a virtual ethernet device is created. To do so, root privileges are required. How is it then managed in rootless containers?**

In rootless containers, networking is managed using user namespaces and virtual network interfaces (veth pairs) that do not require root privileges to create. The Linux kernel supports creating network namespaces and veth pairs within user namespaces, allowing non-root users to manage networking for their containers.

**5. When running a container, usually a layered file system is created, but it requires root privileges. How is it then managed in rootless containers?**

Rootless containers use a technique called user namespace remapping to handle layered file systems (union file systems) without root privileges. The container filesystem is constructed using user-owned directories and files, layered using copy-on-write mechanisms provided by storage drivers like OverlayFS or VFS (Virtual File System).

Rootless containers leverage these mechanisms to build and manage container filesystems securely without exposing the host's root filesystem or requiring root privileges for container operations.

These explanations cover the basics and advantages of rootless containers in Docker environments. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

### OCI

**1. What is the OCI?**

OCI stands for Open Container Initiative. It is an open governance structure under the Linux Foundation designed to create open industry standards around container formats and runtimes. The OCI aims to ensure container interoperability across different container runtimes and platforms.

**2. Which operations OCI based containers must support?**

OCI based containers must support the following operations to comply with OCI specifications:

- **Container Runtime Specification:** Define how containers should be run, including lifecycle management (create, start, stop, delete), attaching to containers, and inspecting container metadata.
  
- **Image Specification:** Define how container images are structured, including image formats, layers, and metadata. It also includes operations like pulling images from registries, pushing images to registries, and inspecting image configurations.

### Scenarios

**Scenario 1: There is a running container that has a certain issue. You would like to share an image of that container with your team members, with certain environment variables set for debugging purposes. How would you do it?**

To share an image of the running container with environment variables set for debugging purposes:

1. **Stop the Running Container (if necessary):** If the container is running and you want to share its state at a specific point, stop the container gracefully.

   ```bash
   docker stop <container_id_or_name>
   ```

2. **Commit the Container State to a New Image:** Create a new image from the container's current state. This new image will include any modifications or environment variables you have set for debugging.

   ```bash
   docker commit <container_id_or_name> <new_image_name>:<tag>
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   docker commit my-container my-debug-image:debug
   ```

3. **Push the Image to a Registry (Optional):** If you want to share the image with your team, push it to a container registry (like Docker Hub).

   ```bash
   docker push <new_image_name>:<tag>
   ```

4. **Share the Image with Your Team:** Provide your team members with the image name and tag so they can pull and run the image.

**Scenario 2: You and your team work on the same project, but different versions of it. For each version, the team creates a new, separate image. What would you suggest the team to change in such case?**

When working on different versions of the same project and creating separate Docker images for each version, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Use Docker Tags:** Instead of creating entirely new images for each version, use Docker tags to differentiate versions of the same image. Tags allow you to have multiple versions of the same base image.

   Example:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-project:version1 .
   docker build -t my-project:version2 .
   ```

2. **Use Dockerfile and Build Arguments:** Utilize build arguments in your Dockerfile to customize each build for different versions while using the same Dockerfile.

   Dockerfile example:

   ```dockerfile
   ARG VERSION

   FROM base-image:latest
   ...
   ENV APP_VERSION=$VERSION
   ```

   Build commands:

   ```bash
   docker build --build-arg VERSION=1 -t my-project:version1 .
   docker build --build-arg VERSION=2 -t my-project:version2 .
   ```

3. **Version Control:** Use version control (like Git) to manage Dockerfiles and ensure that each version-specific Dockerfile is appropriately versioned and maintained.

4. **Automated Builds:** Implement automated build pipelines (using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions) to build and push Docker images for each version whenever changes are made.

By following these practices, your team can effectively manage and deploy different versions of the same project using Docker containers, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance across different versions.
