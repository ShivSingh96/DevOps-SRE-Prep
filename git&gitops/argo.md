Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes applications. Let's address your questions about Argo CD:

### 1. What is Argo CD?

Argo CD is a GitOps-based continuous delivery tool specifically designed for Kubernetes. It automates the deployment of applications and configurations stored in Git repositories to Kubernetes clusters. It ensures that the desired state of your applications in the cluster matches the state defined in Git, providing automated synchronization.

### 2. Added Value of Argo CD

Argo CD introduced several key features and benefits compared to traditional CI/CD systems:
- **Declarative Configuration**: Applications are defined declaratively in Git repositories, allowing for version control and reproducibility.
- **Automated Synchronization**: Ensures that the state of applications in Kubernetes clusters matches the desired state defined in Git repositories.
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Provides the ability to roll back to a previous version of an application configuration or deployment.
- **Integration with Kubernetes**: Native integration with Kubernetes resources and manifests, making it well-suited for Kubernetes-native applications.
- **Extensibility**: Supports Helm charts and Kustomize for application configuration and templating.

### 3. Example Workflow Using Argo CD

An example workflow using Argo CD typically involves:
- Developers push application manifests (Kubernetes YAML, Helm charts, Kustomize overlays) to a Git repository.
- Argo CD continuously monitors the Git repository for changes.
- Upon changes, Argo CD automatically deploys or updates the corresponding applications in the Kubernetes clusters connected to it.
- If manual changes are made directly to the cluster, Argo CD detects the drift from the desired state (defined in Git) and can optionally revert the changes or trigger alerts.

### 4. True or False: Argo CD Supports Kubernetes YAML but Not Helm Charts and Kustomize

False. Argo CD supports Kubernetes YAML files, Helm charts, and Kustomize overlays. It treats these as application manifests that define the desired state of applications running in Kubernetes clusters.

### 5. GitOps Repository in Argo CD

In the context of Argo CD, a GitOps repository refers to a Git repository that contains all the configuration and manifests (Kubernetes YAML, Helm charts, Kustomize overlays) for applications deployed and managed by Argo CD. This repository serves as the single source of truth for the desired state of applications.

### 6. Advantages of Using GitOps Approach/Repository

The advantages of using a GitOps approach with Argo CD include:
- **Version Control**: Configuration and application state are versioned in Git, enabling auditability, rollbacks, and collaboration.
- **Automated Synchronization**: Changes made in the Git repository automatically trigger updates or deployments in the Kubernetes clusters, ensuring consistency.
- **Reproducibility**: Applications can be deployed consistently across different environments (development, staging, production) by applying Git commits.
- **Visibility and Traceability**: Changes made through Git commits provide clear visibility into who changed what and when, enhancing accountability and troubleshooting.

### 7. Manual Changes by Sorina

If Sorina makes manual changes to the cluster that override some configuration managed by Argo CD:
- Argo CD will detect the configuration drift during its periodic synchronization or on-demand sync.
- Depending on the configuration of Argo CD, it may revert the cluster state back to the desired state defined in the Git repository to maintain consistency.
- Administrators can configure Argo CD to either automatically revert changes or notify them to manually intervene and reconcile the differences.

In summary, Argo CD leverages GitOps principles to automate Kubernetes application deployments and configurations, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across environments while providing robust integration with Kubernetes resources and manifest formats like YAML, Helm charts, and Kustomize overlays.

Let's address each question about Argo CD one by one:

### 1. ArgoCD Syncing Changes Done Manually to the Cluster

Argo CD is designed to enforce the desired state of applications defined in Git repositories onto Kubernetes clusters. When manual changes are made directly to the cluster:
- Argo CD detects these changes during its synchronization process.
- Depending on its configuration, Argo CD can either:
  - Automatically revert the changes to ensure the cluster reflects the desired state defined in Git.
  - Alert administrators about the detected drift so they can decide whether to revert the changes or take appropriate actions.
  
To directly answer Nate's question: Argo CD is inherently designed to synchronize the cluster state with the desired state defined in Git repositories. It does not have a native capability to ignore changes made manually to the cluster because its primary purpose is to maintain consistency and automation based on the GitOps principles. However, administrators can configure Argo CD's reconciliation policies and automation rules to handle such scenarios effectively.

### 2. Cluster Disaster Recovery with ArgoCD

Argo CD simplifies cluster disaster recovery by:
- **Versioned Configurations**: All configurations (Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize overlays) are stored in Git repositories, allowing administrators to roll back to known good configurations in case of disasters.
- **Automated Synchronization**: Argo CD continuously monitors and reconciles the cluster state with the desired state in Git. In case of disaster, Argo CD can quickly redeploy applications and configurations based on the latest version in Git, reducing downtime and ensuring consistency.
- **Policy Driven**: Administrators can define policies for automatic rollbacks or alerts on configuration drifts, ensuring prompt actions in disaster scenarios.

### 3. ArgoCD as an Extension to Kubernetes vs Jenkins

- **Ella's Claim**: Argo CD is indeed tightly integrated with Kubernetes and operates as a native extension within the cluster. It uses Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to manage applications and configurations declaratively.
  
- **Sarah's Counter-Claim**: While Jenkins can be deployed within Kubernetes clusters, it operates differently from Argo CD. Jenkins is a general-purpose automation server primarily used for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), whereas Argo CD focuses specifically on GitOps-based continuous delivery for Kubernetes applications. The key difference lies in their design philosophies and target use cases:
  - Argo CD integrates deeply with Kubernetes resources and is optimized for Kubernetes-native applications.
  - Jenkins is versatile and can handle a wide range of automation tasks beyond Kubernetes deployments.

### 4. Main Resource in ArgoCD

The main resource in Argo CD is called an **Application**. An Application in Argo CD represents a set of Kubernetes manifests (YAML files, Helm charts, or Kustomize overlays) along with deployment parameters and synchronization policies. It defines how an application should be deployed and managed in one or more Kubernetes clusters.

### 5. Application in ArgoCD

An **Application** in Argo CD is:
- **Declarative Configuration**: It specifies the desired state of a Kubernetes application using Git repositories as the single source of truth.
- **Configuration Management**: Includes application manifests, source repository information, deployment policies, synchronization frequency, health checks, and notifications.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Argo CD automates the deployment and lifecycle management of applications based on changes detected in the Git repository, promoting GitOps practices.

### 6. Access Management in ArgoCD

Argo CD simplifies access management in the cluster by:
- **Integration with Kubernetes RBAC**: Argo CD leverages Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions for accessing and deploying applications.
- **Declarative Access Policies**: Administrators can define RBAC rules within Kubernetes to control who can access and modify applications managed by Argo CD.
- **Centralized Control**: By using Kubernetes-native RBAC mechanisms, Argo CD aligns with the broader Kubernetes security model, making it easier to enforce access policies consistently across the cluster.
  
In summary, Argo CD enhances Kubernetes operations by enforcing GitOps principles, automating application deployments, ensuring disaster recovery readiness, and integrating tightly with Kubernetes RBAC for access management and security. It provides a robust framework for managing Kubernetes applications declaratively and efficiently.

Let's dive into the practical aspects of ArgoCD based on your questions:

### 1. Purpose of `source` section in Application YAML file

```yaml
source:
  repoURL: https://github.com/bregman-arie/devops-exercises
  targetRevision: HEAD
  path: main
```

- **repoURL**: Specifies the Git repository URL where the application manifests are stored.
- **targetRevision**: Specifies the Git revision (branch, tag, commit hash) to use. `HEAD` indicates the latest commit on the default branch.
- **path**: Specifies the directory path within the repository where the application manifests are located.

### 2. Purpose of `destination` section in Application YAML file

```yaml
destination:
  server: http://some.kubernetes.cluster.svc
  namespace: devopsExercises
```

- **server**: Specifies the Kubernetes API server URL where the manifests will be applied. It typically points to the Kubernetes cluster's API server.
- **namespace**: Specifies the Kubernetes namespace where the application will be deployed. In this case, it indicates that the application will be deployed to the `devopsExercises` namespace within the Kubernetes cluster.

### 3. CRD for grouping multiple applications logically

To group multiple applications logically in ArgoCD, you would use the **ApplicationSet** Custom Resource Definition (CRD). ApplicationSet allows you to define and manage multiple Argo CD applications as a single logical entity, enabling you to apply common configurations and sync policies across a group of applications.

### 4. True or False? ArgoCD sync period is 3 hours

False. ArgoCD sync period is configurable, but it is not fixed at 3 hours by default. The sync period can be set according to your operational needs and policies, ranging from minutes to hours or even longer intervals.

### 5. What ArgoCD does every sync period

During every sync period, ArgoCD performs the following tasks:
- **Comparison**: ArgoCD compares the current state of the applications defined in its configuration against the desired state defined in Git repositories.
- **Synchronization**: ArgoCD synchronizes the Kubernetes cluster by applying any necessary changes to align the current state with the desired state from Git.
- **Health Status**: ArgoCD monitors the health status of applications and alerts administrators if any application fails to deploy or encounters issues.
- **Notifications**: ArgoCD sends notifications and updates to administrators and users about the status of deployments, synchronization activities, and any errors or warnings.

### 6. Missing namespace after deploying with ArgoCD

If you deployed a new application in a namespace called "yay" using ArgoCD, but `kubectl get ns yay` does not show the namespace, it indicates that:
- **Namespace Creation Failure**: ArgoCD might have failed to create the namespace due to lack of permissions or issues during the Kubernetes API call.
- **Pre-existing Namespace**: If the namespace "yay" already exists but ArgoCD failed to deploy the application into it, it could be due to synchronization issues or misconfigurations in ArgoCD.

To troubleshoot:
- Check ArgoCD logs for any errors related to namespace creation or application deployment.
- Verify Kubernetes RBAC permissions for ArgoCD to create namespaces.
- Manually create the namespace if it does not exist and ensure ArgoCD's synchronization policies are correctly configured to deploy applications into existing namespaces.

In summary, ArgoCD simplifies application deployment and management in Kubernetes by leveraging GitOps principles, allowing you to define application sources, destinations, synchronization intervals, and manage multiple applications efficiently using CRDs like ApplicationSet.

To accomplish the tasks related to ArgoCD CLI operations as per your requirements, here are the steps and commands you can use:

### 1. Create a new application

To create a new application named `some-app` with specified properties:

```bash
argocd app create some-app \
    --repo https://fake.repo.address \
    --path ./app_path \
    --dest-server https://my.kubernetes.cluster \
    --dest-namespace default
```

- `--repo`: Specifies the Git repository URL.
- `--path`: Path within the Git repository where the application manifests are located.
- `--dest-server`: Kubernetes API server URL for the destination cluster.
- `--dest-namespace`: Kubernetes namespace where the application will be deployed.

### 2. List all ArgoCD apps

To list all applications managed by ArgoCD:

```bash
argocd app list
```

This command will list all applications along with basic information like name, project, sync status, health status, and conditions.

### 3. Print detailed information on the app called "some-app"

To print detailed information about the application named "some-app":

```bash
argocd app get some-app
```

This command will provide detailed information about the specified application, including configuration details, synchronization status, health status, and more.

### 4. Add an additional (external) cluster

To add an additional external cluster for ArgoCD to manage, you typically need to configure the Kubernetes context on the machine where ArgoCD CLI is running. Here’s a general approach:

1. **Update Kubernetes Configuration**: Update `~/.kube/config` or the appropriate kubeconfig file on the machine where ArgoCD CLI is installed to include the external cluster's credentials and context.

2. **Verify Context**: After updating the kubeconfig, verify that you can access the external cluster using `kubectl` commands.

3. **Add Cluster to ArgoCD**: ArgoCD typically uses the kubeconfig file (`~/.kube/config` by default) to manage clusters. Once the cluster is accessible via `kubectl`, ArgoCD will automatically detect it.

### 5. List all clusters managed by ArgoCD

ArgoCD manages clusters based on the kubeconfig file configured on the machine where ArgoCD server or CLI is running. To list all clusters managed by ArgoCD, you can check the kubeconfig file:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

This command lists all the contexts (clusters) available in your kubeconfig file. ArgoCD uses these contexts to interact with Kubernetes clusters. Each context represents a Kubernetes cluster and associated authentication information.

To summarize:
- **Creating an Application**: Use `argocd app create` with appropriate flags to define a new application in ArgoCD.
- **Listing Applications**: Use `argocd app list` to see all applications managed by ArgoCD.
- **Getting Detailed Information**: Use `argocd app get <app-name>` to get detailed information about a specific application.
- **Managing Additional Clusters**: Update the kubeconfig file to include new clusters, and ArgoCD will automatically detect and manage them.

Ensure you have appropriate permissions and access to both ArgoCD and Kubernetes clusters when performing these operations.

### ArgoCD Configuration

1. **Changing Default Sync Period**:
   Yes, it is possible to change the default sync period of ArgoCD. By default, ArgoCD syncs applications periodically based on its configuration. You can adjust the sync period using the `--sync-policy` flag when creating or updating an application. For example, to set the sync period to 5 minutes:

   ```bash
   argocd app create <app-name> --sync-policy automated --self-heal --auto-prune --sync-option <options>
   ```

   Here, `<sync_option>` allows you to specify additional options such as `--sync-option='{"frequency": "5m"}'` to set the sync frequency to 5 minutes.

2. **Setting `timeout.reconciliation: 0s`**:
   Setting `timeout.reconciliation: 0s` in ArgoCD's application settings would effectively disable the reconciliation timeout. This means that ArgoCD will wait indefinitely for the reconciliation process to complete without timing out. This is generally not recommended in production environments because it can lead to hanging operations and potential resource leaks. It might be useful in certain development or testing scenarios where you want to ensure a manual intervention before timing out. However, using a non-zero value for `timeout.reconciliation` is recommended to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure that applications are properly synchronized within a reasonable time frame.

### Advanced ArgoCD

1. **App of Apps Patterns**:
   The "App of Apps Patterns" refers to a design pattern where a single ArgoCD instance is used to manage multiple applications across one or more Kubernetes clusters. Instead of managing applications individually, you create a dedicated "App of Apps" application within ArgoCD. This application is responsible for deploying and managing other applications (sometimes called "child applications" or "leaf applications") within your Kubernetes clusters.

   In this pattern:
   - The "App of Apps" application itself is managed by ArgoCD.
   - It typically resides in its own namespace and GitOps repository.
   - It contains configurations (manifests or Helm charts) for deploying and managing other applications across different namespaces or clusters.
   - This pattern helps in centralizing the management of multiple applications and provides a streamlined approach for handling application deployments, updates, and deletions.

2. **Use Cases for "App of Apps Patterns"**:
   - **Centralized Management**: Use ArgoCD to manage a large number of applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single control point.
   - **Standardization**: Enforce standard deployment practices and configurations across all applications within your organization.
   - **Policy Enforcement**: Implement and enforce policies, security controls, and compliance requirements uniformly across all deployed applications.
   - **Multi-Environment Deployments**: Streamline deployments to multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) by configuring different sets of applications within the "App of Apps" configuration.
   - **Scaling Operations**: Facilitate scaling of operations by reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency in application deployments.

3. **True or False? If you have multiple Kubernetes clusters you want to manage sync applications to with ArgoCD then, you must have ArgoCD installed on each one of them**:
   False. ArgoCD operates as a centralized GitOps tool that can manage multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single instance. You do not need to install separate instances of ArgoCD on each Kubernetes cluster. Instead, you can configure a single ArgoCD instance to connect and manage applications across multiple clusters using context and authentication mechanisms.

4. **Managing Updates Across Multiple Clusters**:
   When updating the application GitOps repository and applying changes across dev, staging, and prod clusters simultaneously, several challenges may arise:
   - **Rollout Strategy**: Each cluster might have specific rollout strategies (e.g., canary, blue-green) that need to be managed independently.
   - **Configuration Drift**: Changes made manually to clusters might conflict with GitOps-driven changes, leading to configuration drift and inconsistencies.
   - **Testing**: Updates might impact different environments differently, requiring careful testing and validation before promoting changes across all clusters.

   To manage these challenges effectively:
   - **Use Git Branching**: Maintain separate branches for different environments (dev, staging, prod) to control when updates are applied and validated.
   - **Use ArgoCD Rollouts**: Leverage ArgoCD's capabilities to define custom rollout strategies and ensure controlled deployments across clusters.
   - **Monitor and Validate**: Implement monitoring and validation processes to ensure that updates do not introduce issues in different environments.
   - **Automate Rollbacks**: Prepare rollback procedures and automate them where possible to revert changes in case of issues detected post-deployment.

By adopting these practices, you can mitigate risks associated with simultaneous updates across multiple Kubernetes clusters managed by ArgoCD.

### ArgoCD Application Health

1. **Possible Health Statuses for an ArgoCD Application**:
   ArgoCD applications can have various health statuses that indicate the current state and health of the deployed resources:
   - **Healthy**: All managed resources are in the desired state, and there are no issues reported.
   - **Degraded**: Some managed resources are not in the desired state or have encountered issues, but the application is still partially functional.
   - **Progressing**: Resources are in the process of being updated or modified, and the application is transitioning to a new state.
   - **Suspended**: The application is intentionally suspended, and no changes are being applied.

2. **True or False? A Deployment considered to be healthy if the Pods are running**:
   True. In the context of Kubernetes, a Deployment is considered healthy if all of its associated Pods are running and ready.

3. **True or False? An Ingress is considered healthy if status.loadBalancer.ingress list includes at least one value**:
   True. For an Ingress resource to be considered healthy, it must have at least one valid entry in the `status.loadBalancer.ingress` list, indicating that the Ingress controller has successfully assigned a load balancer IP or hostname.

4. **Health of Custom Kubernetes Resources**:
   The health of custom Kubernetes resources, such as CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) or custom controllers, is typically determined by:
   - **Controller Logic**: Custom controllers manage the state and behavior of custom resources based on defined reconciliation loops.
   - **Condition Status**: Custom resources often define conditions that indicate their health status. These conditions can be checked and monitored to assess the overall health of the resource.
   - **Metrics and Monitoring**: Implementing custom metrics and monitoring for custom resources can provide insights into their health and performance.
   - **Integration with ArgoCD**: When managing custom resources using ArgoCD, health checks and conditions defined within the custom resources are evaluated to determine application health.

   ArgoCD itself relies on the health checks and conditions provided by Kubernetes resources to determine the health status of applications it manages. Therefore, ensuring proper definition and monitoring of custom resource health statuses is essential for maintaining application health and reliability.

### ArgoCD Syncs

1. **Manual Syncs vs. Automatic Syncs**:
   - **Manual Syncs**: These are initiated by users manually through the ArgoCD UI or CLI. They trigger an immediate reconciliation of the application against the desired state defined in the GitOps repository.
   - **Automatic Syncs**: These are triggered automatically by ArgoCD at regular intervals (based on the sync period configuration) or when changes are detected in the GitOps repository. Automatic syncs ensure that applications are kept up-to-date with the desired configuration defined in the Git repository without manual intervention.

### Auto-Pruning

2. **Auto-Pruning**:
   - Auto-pruning is a feature in ArgoCD that helps maintain the desired state of applications by removing Kubernetes resources that are no longer specified in the GitOps repository. This ensures that only resources defined in the repository are present in the cluster, preventing unused or obsolete resources from accumulating and potentially causing issues.

### Self-Heal in Regards to ArgoCD

3. **Self-Heal in Regards to ArgoCD**:
   - Self-heal refers to ArgoCD's ability to automatically reconcile the state of applications back to the desired configuration specified in the GitOps repository. This includes detecting discrepancies or drifts between the actual state of resources in the Kubernetes cluster and the desired state defined in the repository, and taking corrective actions to bring them back into alignment. Self-healing helps in maintaining application integrity and consistency without manual intervention.

### ArgoCD and Helm

4. **Support Provided in ArgoCD for Helm**:
   - ArgoCD provides robust support for managing Helm charts as part of its application deployments. This includes:
     - **Helm Repositories**: ArgoCD can manage Helm repositories where charts are stored.
     - **Helm Chart Installation**: ArgoCD can deploy Helm charts to Kubernetes clusters and manage their lifecycle.
     - **Helm Chart Dependencies**: ArgoCD handles dependencies specified in Helm charts.
     - **Helm Overrides**: ArgoCD supports overriding Helm chart values using parameters provided in the GitOps repository.
     - **Sync Policies**: ArgoCD allows defining sync policies for Helm applications, specifying when and how applications should be synchronized.

5. **True or False? When ArgoCD tracks Helm chart the chart is no longer an Helm application and it's a ArgoCD app**:
   - True. When ArgoCD tracks a Helm chart, it manages it as an ArgoCD application. This means ArgoCD takes control of deploying and managing the Helm chart's lifecycle, including synchronization, health monitoring, and automatic pruning based on the GitOps repository's desired state. Therefore, from the perspective of management and deployment, the Helm chart is treated as an ArgoCD application rather than a standalone Helm application.

### Argo Rollouts 101

1. **What is Argo Rollouts?**
   - Argo Rollouts is a Kubernetes controller and CRD (Custom Resource Definition) that provides advanced deployment capabilities beyond what is offered by standard Kubernetes Deployments. It allows for progressive delivery techniques such as canary deployments, blue-green deployments, and other advanced rollout strategies.

2. **What happens when you rollout a new version of your app with Argo Rollouts?**
   - When you rollout a new version of your application using Argo Rollouts, it facilitates controlled and automated updates to your application's deployments. Depending on the rollout strategy configured (such as canary or blue-green), Argo Rollouts manages the deployment of the new version, monitors its performance against defined metrics or thresholds, and automates the promotion or rollback based on the observed behavior.

3. **True or False? You need to install ArgoCD in order to use Argo Rollouts**
   - False. Argo Rollouts is a standalone component that operates independently of ArgoCD. While both are part of the Argo project and share some similarities in their GitOps and progressive delivery capabilities, Argo Rollouts can be used separately to manage deployments without requiring ArgoCD.

### Argo Advanced Rollouts

4. **Better Approach for Scott**
   - Instead of manually executing smoke tests and monitoring rollouts, Scott could benefit from leveraging Argo Rollouts' built-in analysis capabilities. Specifically:
     - **Automated Canary Analysis**: Define automated analysis to monitor metrics like latency, error rates, or performance indicators during canary deployments.
     - **Promotion Based on Metrics**: Configure Argo Rollouts to automatically promote the new version to broader segments or roll back based on predefined criteria.
     - **Integration with Monitoring Tools**: Integrate Argo Rollouts with monitoring tools (like Prometheus) to automatically trigger rollbacks if metrics exceed thresholds.

### Analysis in Regards to Argo Rollouts

5. **Analysis in Argo Rollouts**
   - In Argo Rollouts, "Analysis" refers to the capability of evaluating the health and performance of a rollout using metrics collected from the running application. This includes:
     - **Metrics Collection**: Argo Rollouts can collect metrics from your application during a rollout, such as request latency, error rates, or custom application metrics.
     - **Automated Canary Analysis**: Using the collected metrics, Argo Rollouts can perform automated analysis to determine if the new version (canary) meets the predefined criteria for promotion or if a rollback is necessary.
     - **Policy-Based Actions**: Analysis policies allow you to define thresholds and conditions under which a rollout should proceed, pause, or roll back based on the observed behavior of the new version.

Argo Rollouts' analysis capabilities enable more sophisticated and automated deployment strategies, improving reliability and reducing the manual effort required to manage deployments effectively.

The provided YAML configuration defines an `AnalysisTemplate` in Argo Rollouts. Let's break down its components:

### YAML Configuration Explanation

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: AnalysisTemplate
metadata:
  name: success-rate
spec:
  args:
  - name: service-name
  metrics:
  - name: success-rate
    interval: 4m
    count: 3
    successCondition: result[0] >= 0.90
    provider:
      prometheus:
        address: http:/some-prometheus-instance:80
        query: sum(response_status{app="{{args.service-name}}",role="canary",status=~"2.*"})/sum(response_status{app="{{args.service-name}}",role="canary"})
```

### Breakdown of Components

1. **apiVersion and kind**:
   - Specifies the Kubernetes API version (`argoproj.io/v1alpha1`) and the resource type (`AnalysisTemplate`).

2. **metadata**:
   - Defines metadata for the `AnalysisTemplate`, including its name (`success-rate`).

3. **spec**:
   - Specifies the specification for the `AnalysisTemplate`.
   
   - **args**:
     - Defines a list of arguments that can be passed to this analysis template. In this case, it specifies a single argument named `service-name`.

   - **metrics**:
     - Defines metrics to be collected and evaluated during the analysis.
     - **name**: Specifies the name of the metric (`success-rate`).
     - **interval**: Specifies the interval at which the metric should be collected (`4m` indicates every 4 minutes).
     - **count**: Specifies the number of times the metric should be collected (`3` times).
     - **successCondition**: Specifies the condition for success based on the collected metric data (`result[0] >= 0.90`). This condition checks if the first result from the metric query meets or exceeds 90% success rate.
     - **provider**:
       - Specifies the provider for collecting the metric data.
       - **prometheus**:
         - Uses Prometheus as the data provider for the metric.
         - **address**: Specifies the address of the Prometheus instance (`http:/some-prometheus-instance:80`).
         - **query**: Defines the Prometheus query to fetch the metric data. The query sums the `response_status` metrics for the `app` specified by `args.service-name`, filtered by `role="canary"` and `status` starting with `"2."`. The numerator (`sum(response_status{app="{{args.service-name}}",role="canary",status=~"2.*"})`) counts successful responses (status codes starting with 2) for the canary version. The denominator (`sum(response_status{app="{{args.service-name}}",role="canary"})`) counts all responses for the canary version.

### Purpose of the Configuration

This `AnalysisTemplate` configuration is used within Argo Rollouts to define how to analyze the success rate of a canary deployment. It sets up a metric (`success-rate`) that measures the percentage of successful responses (`2xx` status codes) compared to all responses for the canary application (`{{args.service-name}}`). The `successCondition` specifies that the canary deployment will be considered successful if the success rate is 90% or higher across three consecutive measurements taken every 4 minutes from Prometheus.

In summary, this configuration allows Argo Rollouts to automatically monitor and evaluate the success rate of a canary deployment using metrics collected from Prometheus, helping to automate the decision-making process for promoting or rolling back canary releases based on defined success criteria.

To interact with Argo Rollouts using commands, you typically use the `kubectl argo rollouts` commands. Here's how you can perform various operations:

### Argo Rollouts Commands

1. **List Rollouts**:
   ```bash
   kubectl argo rollouts list
   ```
   This command lists all rollouts in the cluster.

2. **List Rollouts of a Given Application**:
   ```bash
   kubectl argo rollouts list <application-name>
   ```
   Replace `<application-name>` with the name of the application whose rollouts you want to list.

3. **Check Rollout Status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl argo rollouts get rollout <rollout-name>
   ```
   Replace `<rollout-name>` with the name of the rollout to check its status.

4. **Rollout a New Version**:
   To rollout a new version with a new container image tag, you can update the rollout's spec and apply the changes:
   ```bash
   kubectl argo rollouts set image rollout <rollout-name> <container-name>=<new-image-tag>
   ```
   Replace `<rollout-name>` with the name of the rollout, `<container-name>` with the name of the container in the pod spec, and `<new-image-tag>` with the new tag of the container image.

5. **Manually Promote to New App Version**:
   ```bash
   kubectl argo rollouts promote <rollout-name>
   ```
   This command manually promotes the rollout to the next available stable version.

6. **Monitor a Rollout**:
   To monitor a rollout, you can watch its status updates in real-time:
   ```bash
   kubectl argo rollouts get rollout <rollout-name> --watch
   ```
   Replace `<rollout-name>` with the name of the rollout you want to monitor.

### Example Usage

Assuming you have an application called `my-app`, here's how you might use these commands:

- **List all rollouts**:
  ```bash
  kubectl argo rollouts list
  ```

- **List rollouts for `my-app`**:
  ```bash
  kubectl argo rollouts list my-app
  ```

- **Check status of a rollout**:
  ```bash
  kubectl argo rollouts get rollout my-app-rollout
  ```

- **Rollout a new version with a new image tag**:
  ```bash
  kubectl argo rollouts set image rollout my-app-rollout my-container=new-image-tag
  ```

- **Manually promote to new app version**:
  ```bash
  kubectl argo rollouts promote my-app-rollout
  ```

- **Monitor a rollout**:
  ```bash
  kubectl argo rollouts get rollout my-app-rollout --watch
  ```

These commands allow you to manage and monitor Kubernetes rollouts effectively using Argo Rollouts. Adjust the commands based on your actual rollout names and configurations.
