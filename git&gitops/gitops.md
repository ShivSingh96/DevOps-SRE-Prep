### GitOps

#### What is GitOps?

**GitOps** is a paradigm or set of practices that use Git as the single source of truth for both application and infrastructure configuration. Here are some key aspects of GitOps:

- **Definition**: GitOps extends the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to include continuous delivery and operational tasks. It advocates for declarative, version-controlled definitions of the entire system.
- **Core Principles**:
  - **Declarative Configuration**: Infrastructure and application configurations are described declaratively (what the end state should be) rather than imperatively (how to achieve the state).
  - **Version Control**: All configurations, including infrastructure manifests, deployment scripts, and application code, are version-controlled in Git repositories.
  - **Automation**: Changes to the system are automatically applied through automated pipelines triggered by Git events (e.g., pull requests, commits, merges).
  - **Observability**: Continuous monitoring and auditing of the system state against the desired state defined in Git.
  
#### Advantages of GitOps

- **Consistency**: Ensures that the entire system (infrastructure and applications) is always in the desired state defined in Git.
- **Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration among teams by providing a single source of truth and enabling code reviews for changes.
- **Automation**: Automates the deployment and management of applications and infrastructure, reducing manual intervention.
- **Traceability**: Provides a clear audit trail of changes made to the system, enhancing transparency and compliance.
- **Resilience**: Facilitates quick recovery from failures by enabling rollback to previous known good states defined in Git.

#### GitOps Repository

When referring to a "GitOps Repository":

- It means a Git repository specifically designated to store all configurations, manifests, scripts, and policies related to the GitOps workflow.
- This repository serves as the central hub where all changes and updates to the system are managed and tracked.

#### Practical Implementations or Practices of GitOps

Some practical implementations or practices of GitOps include:

- **Continuous Deployment**: Automating deployments directly from Git repositories based on changes in the repository.
- **Automated Testing**: Running tests automatically on new commits or pull requests to ensure changes don't break the system.
- **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Using Git repositories to store infrastructure-as-code templates (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) for managing cloud resources.
- **Configuration Management**: Storing Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or other configuration files in Git for managing application configurations.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Integrating monitoring tools that continuously verify the system state against the definitions in Git and alert on deviations.

#### Where to Put Configuration and Infra Related Files

The debate between putting configuration and infrastructure-related files in the same repository as the application vs. a separate repository is common. Here are considerations for each approach:

- **Same Repository as Application**:
  - **Pros**: Simplifies versioning and ensures that configuration changes are tightly coupled with application changes.
  - **Cons**: May lead to repository bloat and mixing concerns, potentially making it harder to manage and review changes.

- **Separate Repository**:
  - **Pros**: Enforces separation of concerns, making it clear which repository manages application code vs. infrastructure code.
  - **Cons**: Requires coordination between repositories when changes are made, and may add complexity to CI/CD pipelines.

**Take**: It often depends on the specific needs and scale of the project:
- For smaller projects or rapid development cycles, co-locating configurations with application code may provide simplicity and speed.
- For larger projects or teams with strict separation of responsibilities, maintaining separate repositories ensures cleaner architecture and better organization.

Ultimately, the decision should prioritize clarity, maintainability, and the ability to scale with the project's growth and complexity.
