Certainly! Here are brief explanations for each of your questions:

### How a search engine works?

**Explanation:**
A search engine works by crawling and indexing web pages across the internet. Here’s a simplified process:
1. **Crawling:** Automated bots (crawlers or spiders) follow hyperlinks from one web page to another, collecting information about each page they visit.
2. **Indexing:** The information gathered from web pages is stored in an index, which is a database of words and their locations (URLs) on the web.
3. **Ranking:** When a user enters a search query, the search engine retrieves relevant pages from its index. Pages are ranked based on relevance and authority (using algorithms like PageRank) to display the most useful results first.

### How auto completion works?

**Explanation:**
Auto completion (or autocomplete) predicts the rest of a word or phrase a user is typing based on previous entries. Here’s how it typically works:
1. **User Input:** As a user types, the autocomplete system starts suggesting completions based on the characters entered.
2. **Suggestions:** Suggestions are generated from a database of frequently used search queries, phrases, or words stored in the autocomplete system.
3. **Prediction:** The system uses algorithms (often based on statistical models or machine learning) to predict the most likely completions based on patterns in past user behavior.
4. **Presentation:** Suggestions are presented in real-time as the user types, often displayed in a dropdown list or as inline text.

### What is faster than RAM?

**Explanation:**
There isn't a widely accepted technology that is consistently faster than RAM (Random Access Memory) for general-purpose computing tasks. However, technologies like CPU cache (L1, L2, L3 caches) can provide faster access times for specific data and instructions that are frequently accessed by the CPU.

### What is a memory leak?

**Explanation:**
A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory for use but fails to release it back to the operating system after it is no longer needed. Over time, repeated memory leaks can deplete the available memory resources of a system, leading to performance degradation or even system crashes.

### What is your favorite protocol?

**Answer:** As an AI language model, I don’t have personal preferences, but one widely appreciated protocol is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which forms the backbone of communication on the World Wide Web.

### What is Cache API?

**Explanation:**
The Cache API is a web API that allows web developers to store responses from network requests in a cache, which can be retrieved later when the same request is made again. It enables web applications to work offline or improve performance by serving content faster from local storage.

### What is the C10K problem? Is it relevant today?

**Explanation:**
The C10K problem refers to the challenge of handling 10,000 simultaneous client connections on a single server. It was a significant issue in the early 2000s when network infrastructure and server software were less optimized for handling large numbers of connections efficiently.

**Relevance Today:**
Today, advances in networking, server hardware, and software (such as event-driven programming models and asynchronous I/O) have largely mitigated the C10K problem. Modern web servers and frameworks are capable of handling tens of thousands to millions of concurrent connections efficiently, making the C10K problem less relevant in contemporary computing environments.
