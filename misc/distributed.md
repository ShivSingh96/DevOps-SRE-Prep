### Distributed Computing (or Distributed System)

**Definition:** Distributed computing refers to a system in which multiple computers work together to achieve a common goal. In a distributed system, individual computers (nodes) are physically separate and communicate with each other over a network. These systems are designed to handle large volumes of data or computational tasks that would be impractical or impossible for a single computer to process.

**Key Characteristics:**
1. **Concurrency:** Multiple nodes can execute tasks concurrently, enhancing performance and scalability.
   
2. **Fault Tolerance:** Distributed systems are designed to continue operating even if some nodes fail or become unreachable.
   
3. **Scalability:** Can easily scale by adding more nodes to the system as the workload increases.
   
4. **Decentralization:** No single point of failure or control; tasks are distributed across multiple nodes.

### Causes of System Failure in Distributed Systems

Several factors can contribute to system failures in distributed computing:

1. **Network Failures:** Issues such as network partitions, latency, or communication errors between nodes.
   
2. **Node Failures:** Individual nodes in the system may fail due to hardware malfunctions, software errors, or resource exhaustion.
   
3. **Concurrency Issues:** Race conditions, deadlocks, or synchronization problems when multiple nodes attempt to access shared resources simultaneously.
   
4. **Software Bugs:** Programming errors or inconsistencies in the distributed application code.
   
5. **Data Integrity Issues:** Inconsistent or incorrect data due to replication delays or failures in maintaining data consistency across nodes.

### CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem)

**Definition:** The CAP theorem, formulated by computer scientist Eric Brewer in the late 1990s, states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:

1. **Consistency (C):** Every read receives the most recent write or an error. In other words, all nodes in the distributed system have the same data at the same time.
   
2. **Availability (A):** Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.
   
3. **Partition tolerance (P):** The system continues to operate despite network partitions (communication failures) between nodes.

According to the CAP theorem, a distributed system can prioritize any two of these guarantees, but not all three simultaneously. For example:

- **CA Systems:** Prioritize Consistency and Availability, sacrificing Partition Tolerance. They ensure that every read receives the latest write and respond to all requests, but may not be available during network partitions.
  
- **CP Systems:** Prioritize Consistency and Partition Tolerance, sacrificing Availability. They ensure that all nodes have consistent data and continue to operate during network partitions, but may not respond to all requests.
  
- **AP Systems:** Prioritize Availability and Partition Tolerance, sacrificing Consistency. They ensure that all requests receive a response and continue to operate during network partitions, but data consistency may be compromised.

Understanding the CAP theorem helps in designing and selecting appropriate trade-offs for distributed systems based on specific requirements for consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.

### Shared-Nothing Architecture

**Definition:** Shared-Nothing architecture is a distributed computing architecture where each node (or server) in the system operates independently without sharing significant state with other nodes. In this model, nodes communicate with each other via messages over a network but do not share memory or disk storage. Each node in a shared-nothing system typically manages its own resources and data independently.

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Independence:** Each node operates autonomously, making decisions and managing resources without relying on coordination or shared state with other nodes.

2. **Scalability:** Shared-nothing architectures are inherently scalable because new nodes can be added to the system without requiring coordination or shared resources.

3. **Fault Isolation:** Failures in one node do not affect the operation of other nodes since there is no shared state that could be corrupted or compromised.

4. **Flexibility:** Nodes can be heterogeneous in terms of hardware or software configurations because they do not need to share resources or state.

5. **Concurrency:** Multiple nodes can execute tasks concurrently, enhancing performance and throughput by leveraging parallel processing.

**Use Cases:**
- **Database Systems:** Many modern distributed databases, such as Cassandra and MongoDB, adopt a shared-nothing architecture to achieve scalability and fault tolerance.
  
- **Web Applications:** Microservices architectures often use shared-nothing principles, where each microservice operates independently and communicates with others via lightweight protocols.

### Sidecar Pattern (Sidecar Proxy)

**Definition:** The Sidecar Pattern is a software design pattern where additional processes (sidecars) are deployed alongside an application's primary container to provide supporting features or functionality. In the context of microservices architectures and containerized applications, a sidecar container runs alongside the main application container within the same pod in Kubernetes or as a separate container in other deployment models.

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Proxying and Interception:** The sidecar container intercepts and manages network communication between the main application container and external services. It acts as a proxy for inbound and outbound traffic.

2. **Feature Extension:** Sidecars provide additional capabilities such as logging, monitoring, security (e.g., TLS termination), or service discovery without requiring changes to the application code.

3. **Separation of Concerns:** By separating cross-cutting concerns into sidecar containers, the main application container can remain focused on its core business logic, promoting modularity and maintainability.

4. **Platform Independence:** The Sidecar Pattern is not limited to specific platforms but is commonly used in container orchestration environments like Kubernetes.

**Use Cases:**
- **Service Mesh:** In service mesh architectures (e.g., Istio, Linkerd), sidecar proxies manage service-to-service communication, enforce policies, and collect telemetry data.
  
- **Logging and Monitoring:** Sidecar containers can aggregate logs or metrics from multiple application instances and forward them to centralized logging or monitoring systems.

- **Security:** Sidecars can handle tasks like authentication, authorization, or encryption/decryption of communication channels between services.

The Sidecar Pattern enhances flexibility, scalability, and resilience in distributed systems by decoupling cross-cutting concerns from application logic, making it a powerful tool in modern cloud-native architectures.
