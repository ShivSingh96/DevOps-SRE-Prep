### Global Infrastructure in GCP

**Zone**:
- **Definition**: A zone in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a deployment area within a region. Each zone is isolated but connected to other zones within the same region through low-latency links.
- **Purpose**: Zones are used to provide fault tolerance and high availability by ensuring that applications and data are replicated across multiple zones within a region.

**Region**:
- **Definition**: A region is a geographical location where Google Cloud resources are available. Each region consists of multiple zones.
- **Purpose**: Regions allow you to deploy applications and services close to your users to reduce latency, and they provide geographic redundancy for high availability.

**True or False? Each GCP region is designed to be completely isolated from the other GCP regions**:
- **True**: GCP regions are isolated from each other to provide data locality and regulatory compliance options for customers.

**Considerations when choosing a GCP region for running a new application**:
- **Proximity to Users**: Choose a region closest to your users to minimize latency and improve performance.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Consider data residency and regulatory requirements that may mandate where your data can be stored.
- **Service Availability**: Check which GCP services are available in the region you choose to ensure all required services are supported.
- **Redundancy**: Opt for regions with multiple zones for higher availability and fault tolerance.
- **Cost**: Pricing may vary between regions, so evaluate cost implications based on the region's pricing structure.

**True or False? All GCP services are available in all regions zones**:
- **False**: While most GCP services are available in multiple regions, not all services are available in every region. It's essential to check service availability in the specific regions you plan to use.

### gcloud

To list all regions using the `gcloud` command-line tool in GCP:

```bash
gcloud compute regions list
```

This command will list all available regions along with their IDs, names, and status.

In summary, GCP's infrastructure is organized into regions and zones to provide geographic distribution, fault tolerance, and high availability. When choosing a region, consider factors like proximity to users, compliance requirements, service availability, redundancy, and cost. Use `gcloud compute regions list` to view all available regions in GCP.

### Resource Hierarchy in GCP

In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the resource hierarchy is structured as follows:

1. **Organization**:
   - An organization is the root node of the hierarchy and represents a GCP account that can encompass one or more projects.
   - It's typically associated with a domain or company and provides centralized management and billing for projects within it.

2. **Projects**:
   - Projects are containers for GCP resources and services. They serve as a unit of isolation and management.
   - Resources such as VM instances, storage buckets, databases, etc., are created and managed within projects.
   - Each project has its own set of IAM policies, quotas, and billing settings.

3. **Resources**:
   - Resources are the actual GCP services and infrastructure components like Compute Engine instances, Cloud Storage buckets, BigQuery datasets, etc.
   - These resources are created and exist within projects.

### True or False?

**True or False? In a project, you can have one or more organizations**:
- **False**: In GCP, an organization can have one or more projects, but a project belongs to exactly one organization. A project cannot belong to multiple organizations.

**True or False? A resource has to be associated with at least one project**:
- **True**: All GCP resources must be created within a project. Projects serve as the organizational unit for resources and provide management boundaries.

**True or False? Project name has to be globally unique**:
- **True**: Project names in GCP must be globally unique across all GCP projects. This uniqueness is enforced to ensure clarity and avoid naming conflicts.

### IAM and Roles

**Explain roles and permissions**:
- **Roles**: In GCP, roles are sets of permissions that define what actions can be performed on resources. Roles are applied to identities (users, groups, or service accounts).
- **Permissions**: Permissions are individual privileges that allow specific actions, such as read, write, or administer, on resources within GCP.

**True or False? Permissive parent policy will always overrule restrictive child policy**:
- **True**: IAM policies in GCP follow a hierarchy where parent policies can grant more permissions than child policies. If a parent policy grants a permission, a child policy cannot revoke it, but can further restrict it. However, IAM policies are additive, so permissions are granted based on the union of all applicable policies.

In summary, GCP's resource hierarchy starts with organizations that contain projects, and projects contain resources. Resources must belong to a project, and project names must be globally unique. IAM roles define sets of permissions, and policies are structured hierarchically with parent policies potentially overriding child policies.

### Labels and Tags in GCP

#### Labels
**Labels** in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are key-value pairs that can be attached to resources such as instances, disks, networks, etc. They are used to organize resources and apply metadata to them. Some key points about labels:

- **Usage**: Labels are used for organizing resources into groups based on common attributes. They do not affect the resource's behavior but are helpful for operations like filtering, aggregation, and billing.
  
- **Examples**: 
  - Labeling instances by environment (e.g., `env: production`, `env: development`).
  - Labeling resources by application (e.g., `app: frontend`, `app: backend`).
  - Labeling resources by role (e.g., `role: webserver`, `role: database`).

#### Network Tags
**Network tags** are specific to Google Cloud's networking services, such as Compute Engine instances and Google Kubernetes Engine nodes. They serve a similar purpose as labels but are specifically used for applying firewall rules and network policies. 

- **Usage**: Network tags are used to control network traffic to and from instances by associating them with firewall rules. They help in managing access control and network segmentation.

- **Difference**: While labels are more general-purpose and can be used across various GCP resources, network tags are specifically used within the context of networking and firewall rules.

### gcloud Commands

#### List the labels of an instance called "instance-1"
To list the labels of an instance named "instance-1", you can use the following `gcloud` command:

```bash
gcloud compute instances describe instance-1 --format="json(labels)"
```

#### Update a label to "app=db" for the instance called "instance-1"
To update a label on an instance named "instance-1" to `app=db`, you would use the `instances add-labels` command:

```bash
gcloud compute instances add-labels instance-1 --labels=app=db
```

#### Remove the label "env" from an instance called "instance-1"
To remove a label named `env` from the instance "instance-1", you can use the `instances remove-labels` command:

```bash
gcloud compute instances remove-labels instance-1 --labels=env
```

These commands allow you to manage labels associated with GCP resources directly from the command line, providing flexibility in organizing and managing resources based on metadata attributes.

### Compute Engine

#### gcloud Command to Create an Instance

To create an instance named "instance-1" in Google Cloud Platform using `gcloud` with the specified properties:

```bash
gcloud compute instances create instance-1 --machine-type=e2-micro --labels=app=web,env=dev
```

This command will create a virtual machine instance named "instance-1" with:
- **Machine Type**: `e2-micro` (a small machine type suitable for low-resource applications)
- **Labels**: `app=web` and `env=dev`, which are key-value pairs used for organizing and managing resources.

### GCP Networking

Google Cloud Platform offers robust networking capabilities that enable users to build scalable, reliable, and secure applications. Some key aspects of GCP networking include:

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**: Provides a logically isolated network within GCP where users can deploy their resources. Each project can have one or more VPCs.
  
- **Subnets**: VPCs are divided into subnets, which are IP ranges within the VPC. Subnets are associated with a specific region and availability zone.

- **Firewall Rules**: Control traffic to and from instances based on IP addresses, protocols, and ports. Firewall rules can be applied at the VPC or instance level.

- **Load Balancing**: GCP offers Global Load Balancing for distributing traffic across regions and zonal Load Balancing for distributing traffic within a region.

- **Cloud Interconnect**: Allows customers to connect their on-premises network to GCP securely.

- **Network Peering**: Enables connectivity between VPC networks across different projects or organizations.

### Cloud Functions

**Cloud Functions** is a serverless execution environment on Google Cloud Platform that allows you to run your code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. Key features include:

- **Fully Managed**: Google manages replication, patching, backups, and maintenance.

- **Integrated**: Integrates with other Google Cloud services like App Engine, Compute Engine, and Cloud Functions.

### Network Tags

**Network tags** in Google Cloud Platform are used specifically for applying firewall rules to Compute Engine instances and Google Kubernetes Engine nodes. They serve as metadata labels that help control network traffic by associating instances with firewall rules based on tags.

- **Usage**: Network tags are attached to instances and used in firewall rules to allow or deny traffic based on predefined criteria (e.g., source IP address, protocol, port).

- **Flexibility**: Tags allow administrators to apply granular access controls and segmentation to instances based on their roles or applications.

- **Difference from Labels**: While both labels and network tags are key-value pairs used for organizing and managing resources, network tags are specifically used within the context of networking and firewall rules to control traffic flow.

### Flow Logs

**Flow logs** in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) capture and record network flows (both ingress and egress) for a VPC network or subnet. They provide visibility into network traffic patterns, which can be useful for troubleshooting, monitoring, and security analysis.

- **Enabled**: Flow logs are enabled at the VPC network or subnet level. When enabled, flow logs capture information such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and timestamps of packets.

### Listing Buckets

To list buckets in Google Cloud Storage using `gcloud` command-line tool:

```bash
gsutil ls
```

This command lists all buckets in your default project.

### Compute Metadata Key for Startup Code
